First we get acquainted with domestic animals, like for example, fluffy kittens and playful dogs. On the street, we come across small insects and chirping, spotted birds. In the zoo we can view wild animals, such as rabbits, a fox, and a bear. Every time we learn more and more about these co-habitants of our Earth! Some of them creep along, while others run on their paws; still others soar through the air! Some prefer to live in burrows, some in nests, while others just live in the trees or sleep in meadows. You'll see huge elephants and hippopotamuses, small chameleons and frogs, fast lions and slow turtles - herbivores and predators alike. We invite you to get acquainted with these marvelous representatives of the animal kingdom on the pages of our game!  \r\n\r\nConnect points is a learning puzzle for small children. It helps develop thinking, improve memory and attention. The application has three game modes: by numbers, letters and coloring. Game modes with letters and numbers will be useful for kindergarten and pre-K kids. \r\nConnecting by numbers will help to easily memorize the order of numbers and learn to count. To do this, you need to consecutively connect circles with numbers starting from 1. As you connect circles in the right order, the silhouette of a hidden picture will become more and more visible. If three points are chosen incorrectly, a tip will pop up. Once all the points are fully connected, the picture will become fully visible and you’ll be able to color it.\r\nThose studying the alphabet can choose to connect points by letters. It is important that children know letters as early as possible, since it is essential for learning to read and write. But knowing the order of letters in the alphabet is also very important! This can be achieved by connecting circles with letters in the right sequence.\r\nThe coloring mode will be especially appreciated by young artists. In this mode, you can proceed to coloring pictures without connecting points. To make the process even more exciting, you can change any predefined color. To do this, press and hold the paint bucket and choose the necessary color from the palette.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

Children can choose to color by geometrical figures and pictograms in addition to numbers. A child can easily distinguish a square from a circle, diamond, and triangle.\r\nSchool-age children will enjoy the complex coloring mode.

This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.\r\nThose who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter. Coloring by letters will be useful for children preparing to enter primary school.\r\nTo make the coloring process more interesting and fun, you can change any of the preset colors.

This isn't a shoot-em-up, just a laid-back, enjoyable way to learn how to play poker. Relax and have fun!\r\n\r\nAnnie, Cowboy, Gambler, and The Kid are four wisecracking card sharks who will try to take your money!\r\n\r\nEach player has his own unique style of play - and playing against those styles, combined with the Hints and context-based Strategy, should help you learn how to play poker. \r\n\r\nPlayers:\r\nAnnie: Annie is no stranger to these tables and she is much tougher than she looks. To her, poker is much more than a game, its how she makes her living. If you're not careful, she will take your money in a big hurry! She doesn't like to lose so she'll fold on a weak hand but bet hard on a strong one.\r\n\r\nCowboy: The Cowboy is a tough one to figure out. Maybe he's had a tough day and is distracted. Maybe he's just not very good at poker. Sometimes he'll fold on a good hand and bluff a bad one. However, if he has a really good hand, he'll usually bet.\r\n\r\nKid: The Kid is in town looking for a good time. He has money to burn and has been in the Casino a bit too long. His loose and passive play can be irritating. He'll make a mistake or two but be careful, he can fool you into losing your money!\r\n\r\nGambler: The Gambler is a bona fide \"shark\" and knows the odds. He is here for one reason only - to take your money! He plays tight and aggressive which means he'll usually bet on a hand he thinks can win. If he doesn't think he'll win a hand, he'll fold so be careful when he decides to bet. He'll bluff every now and then, just to keep you on your toes.\r\n\r\nLearn to Play:\r\nYou have many options for hints and strategy. Hints are displayed to help you decide whether to Bet, Raise, Call, or Fold. The Strategy Mode gives you more information about your hand and your odds of improving. You also have the option of seeing your opponents’ cards during the deal! \r\n\r\nIf you find a bug or enjoy the program, please let us know!

The auto nudge will automatically offer the largest prize win available for the nudge amount and the reels you are on which is a real help to the player and ensures the player is offered the highest prize win possible for the circumstances and if collected, the auto nudge will also use the nudges and automatically nudge to the prize win offered).\r\n\r\n-Trial Jackpot Gold Run Repeater-(When the trail is on number twenty eight you will win the Jackpot and a random amount of steps on the Gold Run, which will repeat the Jackpot if you spin a successful Gold Run, so the more steps you have on the Gold Run, the more real the chance of a successful repeat).\r\n\r\n-Prize Win Gamble, Game Board Feature offer and Game Board Feature Shuffle-(When you get a prize win on the fruit machine, you will be offered a prize win gamble, except in the case of Jackpot wins and you’ll be offered an exchange to a game board feature and you’ll be offered a game board feature shuffle.

With an endless gameplay, Floaties will keep you hooked as you travel 8 different worlds filled with specific obstacles. All you have to do is tap to keep the characters floating, but the easy controls are balanced by an almost impossible gameplay. Dare to take this challenge?\r\n\r\nMain Features:\r\n✔ Endless Floating Gameplay. Control up to 4 “floaties” at the same time each with its own color by simply tapping to help them float. Each floatie is immune to the same color obstacles but is destroyed instantly by obstacles with other colors. Your main goal is to have a fleet of all colors and to try surviving the longest. Easy to play, but impossible to survive for long!\r\n\r\n✔ 8 Adventurous Worlds. Help your floaties survive through the ancient world of Egypt, the sci-fi landscape of the Moon, the unlawful Wild Wild West, the dangerous Jurassic Park and more. Each of the 8 playable worlds feature its own particularities depicted in eye-catching 3D graphics so get ready to dodge out-of-orbit satellites on the Moon, T-Rex bones in Jurassic Park and hundreds others!\r\n\r\n✔ Dozens of Characters. From flying drones, chicken, rockets to E.T., Cleopatra or even Jack the pirate you can unlock more than 40 different fun characters. Collect coins throughout the game and use those to spin the wheel of fortune to get a new random character or unlock your favorite one. Gain experience with each character and level them up to 5 stars!\r\n\r\n✔ Powerups and abilities. Aside coins you can collect special objects that help you gain powerups for a limited time (i.e. collect 4 potion bottles to double your coin collection for 15 seconds). With your new abilities you’ll survive longer and score higher. \r\n\r\n✔ Solve Quests. Each world has a theoretically endless flying/floating gameplay, although in reality you die A LOT, but offers side quests too. Can you collect 7 items of the same color? Or have one of RGBY floatie destroyed a couple of times? The more quests you solve, the tougher that level gets. You start at Easy, advance to Medium and become a master when you reach the Hard level of difficulty.\r\n\r\n✔ Achievements & Leaderboards. Connect via Google Play Services to unlock more achievements and access the social or global leaderboards if your score is high enough. You’ll also be able to analyze the statistics for each world, such as how many items you’ve collected, how many quests you’ve completed, what was the best score and MUCH MORE!\r\n\r\n✔ Multiplayer Challenges. Provoke up to 4 of your friends to a game of keeping floating characters alive! You can play the game in multiplayer mode and this gives 4 users the chance to play Floaties on the same device. Who can be the best? Only practice will tell!\r\n\r\nAside surviving all sorts of entrapments that destroy Floaties of a different color (i.e. than the obstacle color) you must collect coins, power-ups and character resurrection items. Play often and you will be able to get free coins too by pulling the handle of a slot machine. The same game will unlock a random character for 100 coins.\r\n\r\nEach world you play in features awesome 3D graphics and well designed characters that create a great gaming experience especially accompanied by an entertaining soundtrack and sounds.\r\n\r\nTHANK YOU for downloading, playing and rating Floaties!

The goal of each level is to reach the exit, for this multiple combination of commands are necessary. The game is presented in a 2D site view. \r\n\r\nWhile Pingus is based on the idea of Lemmings, it however doesn't try to be an exact clone, it has included a few ideas of its own, like the worldmap or secret levels, which might be familiar from games the Super Mario World and other Nintendo games. It has also a few new actions, like the jumper which weren't presented in the original game. To get an impression of the look of the Pingus game you might want to have a look at some screenshots. \r\n\r\nSource code is available under the GNU GPL V3 License at: https://github.com/Greentwip/Pingus","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PF0DJK84LJ4","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Pinball FX3 - Marvel Pinball Season 2 Bundle","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.21107.14210222252608011.1152921504739303144.e0e70104-6b23-4381-8ffd-43723903bb8c","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"#FFFFFF","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30491.14210222252608011.1152921504739303536.13c85c33-f26b-48c5-bd30-441c48810e4a","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"#FFFFFF","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"€ 29,99","Price":29.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":[""],"ContentIds":[],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"Pc,Xbox One","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Pinball FX3 and the Marvel Universe collide in Marvel Pinball Season 2 Bundle, bringing together a host of tables and packs inspired by Marvel’s exciting cadre of Heroes & Villains in one low priced bundle!\r\nMarvel Pinball Season 2 features the following tables and packs:\r\n\r\n• Civil War\r\n• Deadpool\r\n• Venom\r\n• Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy\r\n• Marvel’s Ant-Man\r\n• Marvel’s Avengers: Age of Ultron\r\n• Marvel Pinball: Avengers Chronicles\r\n• Marvel's Women of Power\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PG265BCG1TK","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Offroad Rock Crawler Driving","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.802.14189296670277540.61a3ab01-f51c-4e30-9393-d7b5064f23f3.babbc6f3-a878-460f-a992-459961c24c81","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37199.14189296670277540.61a3ab01-f51c-4e30-9393-d7b5064f23f3.96a03245-ac52-453a-933c-dd587ba90d14","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"€ 0,99","Price":0.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["GameMavericks.OffroadRockCrawlerDriving_hzcy860754xz2"],"ContentIds":["cf0e3488-a9aa-d86d-66be-aa34d5176dd0","8505c5c9-ea7e-be6f-3e4e-c3f15684709b"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"Pc","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Try extreme crawler driving - where skills are over speed!\r\n\r\nMake your cars crawl over rocks and logs like a mountain cat!

Kids will enjoy as each station lights up with the announcement of a letter.\r\n\r\n2. Drive the Train. Kids get to practice making their very own letters, both upper and lower cases, by carefully tracing the letter on a railroad track with their choice of train car.\r\n\r\n3. Garages with Surprises. Children are now tested to see if they can find the right letter. They need to open the correct garage, as their engine drives inside and pulls out a cargo car with a surprise.\r\n\r\n4. Phonics Cargo Train. This activity teaches children to identify correct letter sounds within the context of words. The child’s task is to load the correct cargo boxes into the train.\r\n\r\n5. Engine Search. Children get to think fast on their feet as they match upper and lower case letters before the trains have time to move away. Phonics is reinforced by hearing the letter’s sound after they make the correct match.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDG19T","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"The Island: Castaway® (Full)","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64787.9007199266305724.8e104c8e-5628-4db4-8ec3-ffaea6dfeb96.8b220dc3-1aff-4b62-b934-23dc866068ca","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17503.9007199266305724.8193795b-02a1-432a-8553-bdef363f0e97.47fbb06d-f4e2-4ab4-90ff-cde2b7520c96","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59522.9007199266305724.7a9b44d7-0ef5-4626-9246-8c16114cef03.64c2c97b-f52c-4eac-9af9-9481217f99a9","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52074.9007199266305724.578ddfb6-3310-41d2-8653-62e994f131b6.9c22eef6-f13c-487e-b1c1-ef5097a18d0f","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.21239.9007199266305724.6a1ef6df-bad2-4a16-a075-f967963ab658.7546202d-5e3d-415e-9df8-db3394d38455","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10552.9007199266305724.c8aed227-12f8-4040-bb16-da616c520bde.d95c8d90-0a36-4363-8c48-39ac891b1eb0","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"€ 6,99","Price":6.99,"AverageRating":4.1,"RatingsCount":"15","PackageFamilyNames":["828B5831.TheIslandCastawayFull_ytsefhwckbdv6"],"ContentIds":["e01b56be-e7e5-2f46-7729-8b057134241e"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"Pc","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Enkele enorme uitdagingen staan je te wachten in The Island - Castaway, een uitzonderlijk verslavende simulatiegame.

It is based on the popular Austrian Tarock - also known as \"Königsrufen (King Calling)\".\r\n\r\nThe complete deck contains 54 cards, 32 color suit cards and 22 tarock cards. The color suits are: Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, and Spades. The tarock cards are labeled by roman numerals from I, II, III, ... to XXII and function in the game as a permanent suit of trumps. The playing order is counter-clockwise. The game starts with an auction process: The player with the highest bidding becomes the game declarer. There are positive games and negative games: In a positive game, the declarer must achieve a minimum number of points to win. In a negative game, the declarer must achieve the announced number of tricks (0 to 2) exactly. Basically, in all games, players have to follow suit. In negative games additionally, each player must overtrump if possible. Because there are special games for the forehand player, it never happens that all players pass and no game comes out. See Game Rules for the details.\r\n\r\nThe current version provides five playing modes:\r\n•Offline mode\r\n In this mode, the user controls at least one player. All other players will be controlled by the simulator \"Tarobot\". The simulator by the way sees only those cards the human player would also see. But you, too, can let the \"Tarobot\" support you in playing. If you select the appropriate setting, it marks the action on the user interface that it would perform in your place.\r\n•Learning mode\r\n In the learning mode you can question any action that the \"Tarobot\" simulator proposes for you. He will then tell you the reasons why he thinks the action makes sense. Of course, the Tarobot is not a person who takes into account the psychology of other players. He is a pure numeric, who expresses everything in numbers to evaluate them with his algorithms. But he knows all the rules and can give the beginner important hints when practicing the game.\r\n•Quiz mode\r\n This mode is a variant of the offline mode. In addition to the fun of playing, you can train your memory and thus your playing skills improve. Randomly selected questions about the current card playing state are presented to you during the game. After you have selected the supposedly correct answer, the solution will be presented to you immediately. Depending on the question you will get different number of points for the correct or also for an almost correct solution. In the quiz statistics you can read the development of your success in a calendar. If you have reached a minimum number of points and a minimum success rate, you will also receive symbolic awards such as flower pot, medal, and cup.\r\n•Online mode\r\n In this mode, up to 4 owners of a full license can play together online. If less then 4 users are participating in an online session, the remaining players are simulated. In parallel to the playing session, a Skype audio conference should be held, enabling the same conversation between the players as in a real card playing group. Before starting the first session, one of the online users must create a online user group. This user becomes the group administrator, responsible for maintaining the group. The lifespan of the group is limited to 90 days initially. By purchasing an add-on, the lifespan can be extended by 365 days per purchase. Online games are subject to charge. The full license already includes 25 payed online games. By purchasing an add-on, the contingent of payed online games can be increased by 100 or 500 games per purchase respectively.\r\n•Autonomous mode\r\n In this mode, the application plays completely independently without user participation. Of course, this is primarily intended for testing. But it can also be fun to watch.\r\n\r\nThe user interface shows a gaming table in the middle where the players can place their cards. On the four sides of the table, the four players are located showing the hand cards, the tricks pile and other details. Only the hand cards of the user-controlled players are shown face-up. All other hands are showing the cards facedown. You - the current Windows user, must control at least one player.\r\n\r\nIn an offline session, you can undo and redo all actions of the game. You may also utilize assistance from \"Tarobot\" while playing. For replaying games, you can allocate a game archive. The archived games can be reopened and automatically replayed to any situation of interest. Experts may even build their very own games based on an existing game by using the edit mode. In this mode, cards can be exchanged freely between the players and between players and the Talon.\r\n\r\nIn an online session, you can play Tarock with your friends wherever they may be. Most of the manipulation and assistance functions of the offline mode are disabled in this case. Even though, the group administrator can enable and disable some them, such as \"undo\", with mutual consent even during a session.\r\n\r\nMultiple settings options allow you to change game parameters and appearance. You may select another color theme or another card face or card back design for example. You even may insert your favorite photo in one of the card backs containing a special photo frame. You can also activate speech output. Then, for example, you will hear the announcements of the simulated players and you do not have to pay so much attention to the screen display.\r\n\r\nIn the comprehensive online-help, you can find a detailed description of the game rules and of the user interface. It also describes how to perform each of the playing tasks.\r\n\r\nKubiTarock is designed for the Universal Windows Platform. You can install and use the app on all devices powered by Windows 10. The user interface adapts itself to the current device capabilities.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDMC82","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"花札@GAMEPACK","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27354.9007199266440001.29873f52-40d1-4715-9d0d-38107572b3fe.d669cd51-6ffa-4666-b00b-96bc26257b6d","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41191.9007199266440001.7d842838-3913-41aa-9c97-09d8db9890b1.3572790d-18c5-4699-8e55-a0b1ba4eae58","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"€ 2,99","Price":2.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["C00078DB.518278175E6F9_tyjbjaxc4qgce"],"ContentIds":["3625ac6f-28a6-15d5-02c3-88c39e8523cc"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"Pc","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"☆Sale Information☆\r\nHaving a sale now !\r\nTake advantage of our special offer !!\r\n-------------------------------\r\nHanafuda is a Japanese traditional card game! \r\n\"Koi-Koi\" is the most popular game of Hanafuda. \r\nDo you choose \"Koi-Koi\" or choose \"Sho-bu\"?\r\nLet's enjoy tactics!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDMZDJ","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Sparkle 2","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51272.9007199266455699.86b23e9d-1aa9-4b31-9e70-61eedb2fc99b.5248e7ae-a7ca-4922-b5b6-35c999da146c","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6316.9007199266455699.ab559daf-80af-48d6-95ab-45711ccfa8e1.f2aaeec9-7852-4d4f-95c9-e82580c3826e","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"€ 5,99","Price":5.99,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"4","PackageFamilyNames":["43844A19.Sparkle2_j6tmt3vnwnhry"],"ContentIds":["2cbe9b0a-811a-f91a-1e3a-95e68074ee67"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"Pc","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"A long time ago, five keys were created.

While some can give you an instant boost to your skills, other can be cursed and besides their negative effects will bind to your hero needing you to remove their curse if you want to get rid of them.\r\n\r\nSpell books, potions, and magic wands can also be found during your adventure but, will require identification scrolls if you don't want to risk casting a curse on yourself or drinking a deadly potion.\r\n\r\nThe game packs lots of content regarding weapons, equipment, and other consumables which combined with the random dungeon generator, makes it deliver a completely unique experience each time you play it.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDNMX2","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Hidden Objects- Travel- Farm- Detective 3 in 1 Pack","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63539.9007199266605937.00af24e7-5ee0-44f4-a120-68ed5559eca5.8ec42477-4ee2-4a29-aac8-a3fd3c689c01","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"€ 0,99","Price":0.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["18224boogygames.HiddenObjects-Travel-Farm-Detectiv_3has56vqfsc8c"],"ContentIds":["18cbcd9a-3663-aa1f-f3e1-7ced096f0831"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"Pc","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"This wonderful hidden object game gives you the unique opportunity to find amazing hidden items with beautiful scenes.\r\n\r\n3 in 1 Pack:\r\n- Travel Hidden Objects\r\n- Farm Hidden Objects\r\n- Detective Hidden Objects","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDRWMV","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Cribbage Board","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.49395.9007199266562255.44cd6f35-4fed-4fc2-9559-4671194b33dc.a6667d0f-396c-477c-8d87-9f95874103a4","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#9C0501","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.55642.9007199266562255.2258941b-73bf-4b08-84c9-5c0d1b158ac3.a2c55ce0-6da8-4bd0-8cf6-b7f57d320040","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#9C0501","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"€ 0,99","Price":0.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["BlacktopInteractiveLLC.CribbageBoard_n0svp4frw1h2g"],"ContentIds":["d2eda06e-5b2c-753e-5809-9768a22f4826"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"Pc","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"If you have any trouble downloading or installing the app, please contact info@blacktopinteractive.com. \r\n\r\nGrab a deck of cards, an opponent and this app to play cribbage anywhere!

She has come there because she believes that the ancient tombs in this place are not sufficiently explored. She thinks that the tombs are actually forgotten and someone has to see what is hiding there.\r\n\r\nDuring her visit to the tombs in Luxor, Nicole realizes that he was right in her assumptions because very soon she starts discovering new things. Namely, she starts finding a lot of valuable objects including eight mummies undiscovered until now. This seems like a really important discovery but the findings don't stop here. Additionally Nicole discovers small statues that weren't found before in Egypt or on any other place around the world. She knows that her discovery is huge so she goes more into details and continues exploring every possible place really carefully.\r\n\r\nLet's look around together with Nicole and see what those tombs hide.

In Terroir, you grow a variety of different grape varietals, craft your wine, and expand and manage your Estate. You'll also have to deal with factors such as weather and random events, which can either make or break your business.\r\n\r\nSome of the game's features and mechanics include:\r\n\r\nChoose from a selection of different grape varieties, each with their own demands.\r\n\r\nDynamic weather system reflecting the unpredictability of real world climate.\r\n\r\nEach complete playthrough lasts 60 in-game years, but Players can continue playing without contributing to their final score.\r\n\r\nCraft wine through the game's 4 winemaking processes: Crushing, Fermentation, Pressing and Ageing. Each type of grape needs to be crafted a certain way to achieve the best results, so you'll have to learn and master each one.\r\n\r\nStart out with a single planting tile, then expand your Estate to up to 33 tiles, using 6 different tile types.\r\n\r\nSome tiles affect the ones around it, so placement is key.\r\n\r\nCustomize your estate with ambient items.\r\n\r\nCHANCE & CIRCUMSTANCE: Terroir's random event and mission system. Players can open the Mystery Box and choose between CHANCE (a random event that could either have a positive or undesirable outcome) or CIRCUMSTANCE (a mission that a Player completes for rewards, or gets penalized for failing).\r\n\r\nJoin Wine Awards for a chance to earn bonuses to your wine's value and your Estate's renown.\r\n\r\nClean, minimalist design and gorgeous low-poly 3D models.\r\n\r\nOriginal soundtrack composed and performed by Singapore's CLARQuinet ensemble.\r\n\r\nPut on your field gloves, grab a pair of pruning shears and build your Chateau literally from the ground up. \r\n\r\nGood luck, and cheers!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N4W0QFH8BTW","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Mystery Tales: The Twilight World","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35741.13979535271604902.0a48d9a8-7751-4f6a-bcf1-4e3e959bc3df.e64b29b6-0d2a-46d0-ad8c-8dda52aeabe1","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42489.13979535271604902.0a48d9a8-7751-4f6a-bcf1-4e3e959bc3df.1ea80807-d081-43cf-b32c-e4fbc8f775e1","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13816.13979535271604902.0a48d9a8-7751-4f6a-bcf1-4e3e959bc3df.afaacc5c-647b-4b86-9a2e-070991720dd2","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38463.13979535271604902.0a48d9a8-7751-4f6a-bcf1-4e3e959bc3df.f2e1f098-a6d4-4a25-ad2c-358915011d19","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"€ 9,99","Price":9.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["BigFishGames.MysteryTalesTheTwilightWorld_bsrvrvej7yy2w"],"ContentIds":["23388605-7e93-562c-bc56-1b35f8f2a463"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"Pc","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"From DominiGames, creators of the Labyrinths of the World, Dark Romance, and Mystery Tales series, comes an all-new tale of mystery to enjoy!\r\n\r\nYou and your daughter, Nancy, can't resist the lovely hotel just off the highway, especially after a long day on the open road.

Play with your friends from Facebook or with random rivals in the network!\r\n\r\nAre you a curling fan? Then try this Ultra-Realistic, 3D, Curling Simulation Game.\r\nYou’re not a curling fan? Try Curling3D anyway and you’ll fall in love with curling and our game.\r\n\r\nCurling3D is one of the best curling simulation games for one or two players. Similar to shuffleboard, the game is played on a flat ice curling sheet, roughly 15x150 feet. Players slide round stones of about 40 pounds towards bull's eye targets at either end. Two teammates may use brooms to sweep the ice in front of the moving stone. Curling3D is a follow-up to MaxNick's successful iCurling game, and adds a new dimension of realism with 3D rendering and on-screen players. Many user suggestions have been integrated into this new curling simulation.\r\n\r\nCurling3D attempts to simulate the excitement of the game by incorporating many aspects of the actual sport. Fundamentally, curling is about force, mass, friction, momentum, rotation and collision. The app exploits the sophisticated physics engine built into the iPhone OS to generate a convincing simulation of all these elements as they interact. In the terminology of curling, the weight is the velocity of the stone; the turn is the rotation of the stone (which affects its trajectory); and the line is the direction of the throw or delivery. Curling3D allows the player to continuously and independently control all three, permitting advanced tactics such as the guard, takeout, and tap. In addition, the app allows the player to sweep the ice while their stone is moving, adjusting trajectory after the delivery.\r\n\r\nTry it… you won’t be disappointed.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGGZHK1C","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Little Mole's Find It","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18134.13510798883287522.02f739bf-d71a-4f96-b3c2-7ab37fc3071f.403271bd-d0e0-45dc-83f5-4084a40e8594","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44970.13510798883287522.77961990-8f4f-48e3-b000-7801741159dc.a05c9a17-676a-4993-b930-9385cac39654","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"€ 2,99","Price":2.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["SiliconJelly.LittleMolesFindIt_6v809z49xp5gp"],"ContentIds":["94f6a8bc-4aad-9ada-9c1b-95d614516510","be8ef4ec-211c-0bb1-4972-43fb9a879769"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"Pc,Mobiel","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"If you love the Little Mole, you need this game!

try the aerobatic simulator licensed by the U.S. Navy!\r\n\r\nExperience flight at 400 mph just 18 inches from your partner’s wing and face the challenge of official maneuvers aboard F/A-18 fighter jets and a C-130 transport aircraft. An assisted driving system allows everyone to learn even the most extreme stunts and thanks to the three play modes, anyone can experience the thrill of a real aerobatic pilot according to their abilities. Do you think you are really an expert? Compete with the simulation mode and push your reflexes to the maximum!\r\n\r\nOFFICIAL and SPECIAL MANEUVERS\r\nDiscover all the secrets of aerobatics with 3D briefing, take complete control and activate the aircraft with the right timing on the rudder, landing gear and smoke deployment! Take off, fly and run all opening maneuvers with the C-130 “Fat Albert”, either \"PARADE PASS\" or \"ASSAULT LANDING,\" with no limits, and you just have to give it your best. Now you can sit in the cockpit as a soloist and perform an \"AILERON ROLL\" to familiarize yourself with your own F/A-18 to then use all your adrenaline in increasingly challenging and complex maneuvers up to formation flying: the \"DIAMOND ROLL,\" \"DELTA BREAK-OUT,\" and \"FLEUR DE LIS\" are just a few examples of all the possible shapes that you will be called upon to perform by covering all roles of the true Blue Angels pilots.\r\n\r\nAIRSHOW\r\nPlan your exhibition by composing real aerobatics with faithfully reproduced official scenarios: NAF El Centro, NAS Key West, Reno, Elmendorf AFB and Baltimore. Your ultimate goal is to complete all airshows! You can do this by executing the real maneuvers in sequence or randomly. You have the freedom of choice. For every maneuver, you decide what role to play: the #1 FLIGHT LEADER, one of the wings, the #2 RIGHT WING and #3 LEFT WING, the #4 SLOT or one of the soloists, the #5 LEAD and #6 OPPOSING SOLO. \r\n\r\nADDITIVE MODE\r\nCreate aerobatic figures with additive mode! Freely position the planes in the scenario you've chosen and decide whether to make them take off. You can start with a standard flight or  high altitude and then take control of each aircraft in sequence. Aim nose up, make a loop, light the smoke, fly as you like, and when you're satisfied, the session for the first plane ends and the second aircraft takes off.

To conquer as much territory as possible. It's initially very simple, and the game can be mastered immediately, but watch out: there's competition, and not everyone can win!\r\nWhether you're bold or more careful, you have to be more cunning than your adversaries by finding the best strategy to conquer the most space. But be careful! You have a weak spot: your tail. If an enemy touches it, that's the end for you.\r\nTry to stay ahead, because victory in Paper.io is never certain until you possess all the territory. Stealing is allowed, and your enemies won't hesitate to do so.\r\nAfter the success of Quiz Run, 1 Pic 8 Words, and Bool, Voodoo now offers you a new gaming and graphics experience inspired by io type games (made popular by agar.io). Enjoy the simplicity and strategy of an io game in a world with unique graphics.\r\nPaper.io is for the whole family and doesn't require an Internet connection.\r\n\r\nThis player will allow you to open your favorite web games inside a self-contained UWP app.  This allows better performance, privacy, and security.  Download all your favorites: diep io (diep.io), Zombs Royale (zombsroyale.io), Agario (agar.io), Slitherio (slither.io), Paper.io (paper.io) and tons more directly from the Windows Store!  Note that  you are paying for the player itself, not the game.  The game can be accessed through a browser normally, but our player provides a more hands-free solution.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NCB3SFJCF8K","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"God of Light: Remastered","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17151.13571742767748570.0405fffd-36c4-40e2-9bef-389d28becbeb.14a35eb4-cc2f-4668-af19-0eba91054599","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39853.13571742767748570.be0ccd12-deb0-4b63-b4e4-90e0104ec8c5.db706e4b-ef62-4365-83a0-c62a68f302f2","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32818.13571742767748570.80fe28a9-d9e2-4a4d-a216-a60d19f1191d.3af707fb-79e2-4594-bef7-95d68685ea61","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5809.13571742767748570.7d7d4cfc-885f-47a8-b77d-61ff8fce0b0b.dd5526f4-83f3-4f20-a803-88bfc79c38e7","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"€ 9,99","Price":9.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["Playmous.22175CEBB1394_mqcchv6w0vt2w"],"ContentIds":["b43d5ab7-6f4b-e29c-c835-01f5f986cdb5","d77e3d79-cbe0-308a-31c4-99a68dfd5cd6"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"Pc,Xbox One","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"God of Light: Remastered is a definitive version of the original award-winning game played by over 15 million people.
