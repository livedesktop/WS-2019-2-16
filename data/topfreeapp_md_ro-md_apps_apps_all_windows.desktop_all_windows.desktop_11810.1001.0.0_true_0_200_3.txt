can be very complex.   Sometimes you find yourself staring at a 2 page to-do list wondering where to start.\r\n\r\nJXCirrus Diary makes sense out of the chaos by taking your to-do list and calendar answering two important questions:\r\n- Can I fit everything in?\r\n- What should I work on first?\r\n\r\nEnter your calendar and your to-do list, and JXCirrus Diary will fit them altogether into a complete plan for the next 9 months.   It will try to make sure tasks are finished by their due date, and high priority tasks are finished first.  Once it has this plan, it can tell you whether you can fit everything in, and what you ought to work on first.\r\n\r\nAt its most basic, JXCirrus Diary is a combination of calendar, to-do list, addressbook and journal.   You can enter your list of jobs for the week, and tick them off as you finish them.   It is nice and quick to enter the information, and JXCirrus Diary will warn you when tasks or appointments are due.

Ads, embedded directly into the video, will be shown.\r\n\r\n• “Audio only” mode. Ideal for music listening.\r\n\r\n• You can set the size and location of the chat, even while in full-screen mode.\r\n\r\n• You can completely disable the chat: it will not consume computer resources, and you will not be in the viewers list.\r\n\r\n• Changes volume by mouse wheel.\r\n\r\n• You can colorize the player interface to your liking.\r\n\r\n• Takes up less RAM.\r\n\r\n• Rapid start-up of the player. This is especially noticeable on slower computers.\r\n\r\n• Allows you to disable stretching the small video to the player size.\r\n\r\n• Allows you to continue viewing the broadcast in another player, for example Media Player Classic, VLC Media Player, or MX Player.\r\n\r\n• Large number of useful (and not so) settings.\r\n\r\nThe player can playback only live broadcasts and does not affect playback of videos.\r\n\r\nI do not recommend using the extension without a mouse, because touch screen support is incomplete.\r\n\r\nIf you have problems with the extension, first read the help. To do this, in the player right click the view area, then in the menu click “Help”. If this does not help, send feedback to the extension developer. If you can not start the player, send feedback by e-mail. The e-mail address is located somewhere on this page.\r\n\r\nThe extension during its installation requires the following permissions:\r\n\r\n• Read and change content on websites you visit. This permission is required to download the video that Twitch stores at random addresses on third-party servers.\r\n\r\n• Read and change your cookies. This permission is used to read your Twitch.tv login status, so you can create clips.\r\n\r\nThe extension is also available for Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox browsers.","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PB07PLRWPFS","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Telerik Tagit","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34180.14133312457275757.cc60e820-e2ed-4ccf-96f5-52aba0158779.d7d6dc89-3cce-4d11-a202-9413ecd8e950","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#0097DF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47199.14133312457275757.be162bef-706c-4149-9ada-317a300b3f23.0d2ecb6b-cad7-4e50-bf4c-5ffb56b36101","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#0097DF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48850.14133312457275757.4bdfe02e-abcd-475b-af67-23a724130ea3.208378ec-bc20-4cc7-ad46-f69d4155fbf1","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#0097DF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30371.14133312457275757.5008e8ec-6f94-4bdf-9edd-c2c396e777dd.87a5c75a-7b58-4966-b95f-8472694eb004","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#0097DF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31220.14133312457275757.d374a163-45b1-4ae7-ab42-29df1e56505e.fad422aa-8766-4ed4-a960-398a2618cfb5","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#0097DF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17263.14133312457275757.2f8131e5-b644-46bc-8df5-64910ab19674.7c378a22-3336-49ad-92f3-412a04b2f1b0","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#0097DF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23746.14133312457275757.b789d294-10dc-4dc9-ae9a-06f020267215.c653074a-753d-4d8b-b96e-2de762c63387","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#0097DF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52140.14133312457275757.8b17db83-7123-4f02-8523-add3aa710867.ab345da3-56a2-4073-b660-9abf5a63660a","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#0097DF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56628.14133312457275757.e0e8b59f-525f-4c28-bf3a-682cad85c672.a47e3ecc-98b7-4f03-8a2f-35b070bd18b8","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#0097DF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Gratis","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["Telerik.TelerikTagit_s803p1t9nr0he"],"ContentIds":["063abf66-953e-5c35-8c44-17b43e4b0127","3cb533d6-eb41-5562-6cd1-0f02bb82cbb0"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Turn the photo collection on your phone into a database.

These objects may be filled with solid colors, patterns, radial or linear color gradients and their borders may be stroked, both with adjustable transparency. Embedding and optional tracing of raster graphics is also supported, enabling the editor to create vector graphics from photos and other raster sources.

to Mars to see it with your own eyes! This sci-fi themed virtual observatory takes you 300 years forward in time, to the age of ubiquitous nanotechnology and virtual presence. You'll be free to travel anywhere on the planet to study its landforms, from ground level up to low orbit. More than 1700 locations are categorized according to feature type and area (cartographic quadrangle), and can be observed at any time of day. See the light of rising sun slowly fill the deep valleys of Coprates, and the magnificent shadows cast at sunset by Olympus Mons, the largest known volcano in our solar system.\r\n\r\nIf you don't mind some fun, upgrade and try out the included 2-4 player strategy game with your friends (on the same device or online), or against the four AIs, each with unique playing style. One of them is even willing to teach you the game! Your playing field is all of Mars, for you to explore and conquer, establishing companies to exploit the resources of the claimed areas and trading on the stock of these companies. Global leaderboards await those who learn to master the game best.\r\n\r\nTo keep you company, there's Ada: more or less abandoned orbital space station, who'd like to regain some of her lost magnitude - with your permission as her new owner, of course. She's always ready for a good chat, but won't mind if you rather talk with your friends (or anyone else) online through the integrated, geolocation-enabled chat interface.\r\n\r\nThere's more to discover as you gain access and help Ada to rebuild herself. But that will be something for you to find out...\r\n\r\n---\r\nAbout hardware requirements: although Mars Observatory may work on your phone, it is designed primarily for tablet and desktop devices with respect to performance considerations and display size. This app will run on most devices with at least 2 GB of RAM (when no other demanding apps are running at the same time), but 4 GB is recommended especially for higher quality settings. Best use experience is with at least medium graphics quality setting, including e.g. terrain scaling, shadows, anti-aliasing, and some space traffic.","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,
