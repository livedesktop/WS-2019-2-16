Click on the up and down button or enter the page count directly. For example, if the original document contains 30 pages, and you choose to split it into documents containing 5 pages each, 6 PDF documents will be created;\r\n\r\nBy page selection: \r\nSelect any pages from an opened PDF document, and the source PDF document would be split into to two new PDF documents which are composed by the selected pages and the unselected pages;\r\n\r\nBy page range: \r\nEnter the page range in the text field to split the document into two new PDF documents. For example, if the source document contains 10 pages, enter 1-4 in the text field to create two new PDF documents, the first document with pages 1, 2, 3 and 4, and the second document with pages 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10;\r\n\r\nBy Bookmarks level:\r\nThe user can split PDF document based on bookmarks.

So when you're writing an HTML file, the CSS and JavaScript inside aren't weirdly broken.  \r\n\r\nMost of you will be looking for for C, C++, Java, PHP, JavaScript, HTML, XML, CSS, Objective C, Python, Ruby, Pascal, SQL, Haskell, Perl, Clojure, Erlang, CoffeeScript, or Visual Basic, and yep, we've got 'em.\r\n\r\nBut we've also got Apache Velocity templates, diffs, ECL, Google Go, Groovy, Haxe, Jinja 2, LESS, Common Lisp, Lua, Github Flavored Markdown, OCaml, properties files, R, RDF, RDF N-Triples, RDF Sparql, reStructuredText_, Rust, Scheme, shell, Sieve filters, Smalltalk, Smarty, the MySQL and Postgres dialects of SQL, TeX / LaTeX / sTeX (no rendering, just highlighting,) VBScript, WikiText in Tiki and Tiddlywiki flavors, XQuery, and YAML.\r\n\r\n... the C# highlighter could use some work. :)  \r\n\r\nBut, seriously.  Now that you have that keyboard, get something done with it.  HaxPad can get you started.","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDFJJ6","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Dynamic Synthesizer","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.16348.9007199266290361.47774e5a-4bc8-4f29-967b-ee60055b77be.aad11f72-973e-492d-9e12-a1af01128631","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46050.9007199266290361.c69e5011-c50f-4478-826c-c6a50058b58a.d42d2cb0-edac-4ff0-90f3-e814bfd23bac","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61542.9007199266290361.553885d6-bb2e-4f7f-8b08-4ab0bcfd482d.26841adf-5c24-48c8-be17-1581db7c3096","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£2.49","Price":2.49,"AverageRating":2.8,"RatingsCount":"5","PackageFamilyNames":["39329SoundDesigner.DynamicSynthesizer_24rsprxr004q6"],"ContentIds":["b1f353de-4d85-f6ff-d0b2-befe9a1c45c8","f78576e0-b183-0082-b187-8e1cf5600fdf","a50db7ab-c16d-9a1e-9b09-99bd71fe730b"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Connect your music keyboard  with a USB cable to your computer and turn it to a Dynamic Synthesizer.

Wondering what you can delete to free things up but don’t know where it all went?\r\nYou need Disk Space Explorer!\r\n\r\nDisk Space Explorer implements a high speed, multi-threaded disk scanning algorithm that can scan an entire Terabyte disk in just over a minute (YMMV).\r\nOnce the disk has been scanned (or even before it has finished) you can drill into large folders and find out what is using up all your space. The entire disk structure is held in memory to allow instant drill down and navigation. If you see a document that you don’t recognise, you can double-click to launch it directly from the interface, or permanently delete it. For more detailed examination you can open Windows Explorer at that location to facilitate other operations such as rename or move.\r\n\r\nAnd that’s not all. Looking for a file but don’t remember where you put it? Disk Space Explorer can quickly search the disk structure in memory for a specific wildcard filename or you can search for files over a certain size.\r\n\r\nNo information, personal or otherwise, is collected by the app, so you can feel safe that your files are secure.\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDCR8Z","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Vectorial Map Viewer","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31733.9007199266365910.5382655c-fd18-4389-9cd3-51d1cabffc6f.db97049a-563f-4211-a48c-5f71b79df209","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":1.7,"RatingsCount":"7","PackageFamilyNames":["30051teq-IT.VectorialMapViewer_z9k3jabemswwg"],"ContentIds":["5c8c2539-22e1-ccb1-b207-694a55fef381"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Vectorial Map allows you to view Mapsforge (OpenStreetMap) offline vector maps.

Additionaly you can access Glycemic Load and carbohydrates contents in foods. There's also a calculator of the Glycemic Load in a given serving. Knowing these values and following a low-carb diet like Montignac, Paleo, Atkins, low-GI and similar, helps avoid weight gain or obesity and lower the risk of diabetes, coronary heart and age-related health diseases.\r\n\r\nThe Glycemic Index features are free and the app contains no ads! The Glycemic Load and Carbohydrates functions cost a few bucks. There is no need to register or login anywhere to use it. All user data are saved in the device.\r\n\r\nThe app's main screen displays three lists of foods where you can find foods with their corresponding glycemic index and glycemic load values. The third list (in the center) is the carbohydrates content in percentage value. You can filter the lists by levels of the GI, GL or carbs and to show only your favorite foods if you need. You can create a list of foods that you eat more frequently so you can quickly check their glycemic index or glycemic load values. Scroll through the list, or use the search field above the list to help you find a particular food. Filter the food table by levels or display your favorite foods only. You can also easily add a food to the lists if you know its GI value ad carbohydrates contents.\r\n\r\nWith My Glycemic Index you can:\r\n\r\n* know good food\r\n* eat smart\r\n* follow low-carb diets\r\n* prevent diseases\r\n* fight weight gain, overweight and obesity\r\n* benefit from modern multilingual app UI\r\n* have the Glycemic Load, Index and carbs data always at hand\r\n\r\nGI means glycemic index. It is a number associated with a particular type of food to indicate the food's effect on a person's blood glucose (blood sugar) level. \r\n\r\nThe Glycemic Load (GL) of food is a number that estimates how much the food will raise a person's blood glucose level after eating it. \r\n\r\nBecause GL is related to the food's effect on blood sugar, low-GL meals are often recommended for diabetic control and weight loss.\r\n\r\nDid you know that recent studies from the Harvard School of Public Health indicate that the risks of diseases such as type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease are strongly related to the GI of the overall diet. In 1999, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) recommended that people in industrialised countries base their diets on low-GI foods in order to prevent the most common diseases of affluence, such as coronary heart disease, diabetes and obesity.\r\n\r\nThe Glycemic load appears to be a significant factor in dietary programs targeting metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and weight loss; studies have shown that sustained spikes in blood sugar and insulin levels may lead to increased diabetes risk. The Shanghai Women's Health Study concluded that women whose diets had the highest glycemic index were 21 percent more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than women whose diets had the lowest glycemic index. For diabetics, glycemic load is a highly recommended tool for managing blood sugar.\r\n\r\nWhat is a low carb diet?\r\nLow-carbohydrate diets or low-carb diets are dietary programs that restrict carbohydrate consumption, often for the treatment of obesity or diabetes. Low-carbohydrate diets are used to treat or prevent some chronic diseases and conditions, including cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, high blood pressure, and diabetes.\r\n\r\nA low-GI food releases glucose more slowly and steadily, which leads to more satisfactory blood glucose readings after meals. A high-GI food causes a more rapid rise in blood glucose levels; this is best for energy recovery after exercise or for a person experiencing hypoglycemia. \r\n\r\nSo, do you know what you eat? Find out now! Install our app and use it for free and simply take control of your health.","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH69CK8","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"PoiViewer10","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24088.13510798886685069.0e2c1217-7643-4db2-b75f-c13b3a072f9a.aa18c035-4199-4195-8af1-5c6e68b5a334","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30478.13510798886685069.806134a5-6039-43cc-8dfc-e826aa19da21.554b96aa-95dd-4e52-98ad-52a3ff56838b","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.8,"RatingsCount":"28","PackageFamilyNames":["52238BjornHolmstedt.POIViewer10_nddpbns7bezbe"],"ContentIds":["c88c4459-fd35-59c9-ba7f-39dab6007aa7","fd45dac5-47d3-bc6e-b94d-eb8aecf75d77"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"   ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Xbox One,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"This program can open files with your Point Of Interests and present them on map.

It should work on Windows 10 phones, but I have not verified that.","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH6CFFX","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Working Contractor","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13336.13510798886609689.b4aa0217-9e40-454f-a4fd-6f32db5f76a2.9193266d-7623-45a2-8604-434df5003017","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#654321","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58835.13510798886609689.46b2411f-ed98-4d38-9864-28f1f2c714cd.27179b5a-40a4-4517-9e87-ef7c2f2b7fec","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#654321","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29968.13510798886609689.19f1f1be-65f1-487d-b0b0-ed295cae3c49.5d6edea3-4716-4e86-86ad-0b98118c488e","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#654321","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3563.13510798886609689.fd7e1118-c33b-4dc2-9226-5ca9022a8d60.cdc60aec-bae4-4985-8319-b5477104635e","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#654321","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8186.13510798886609689.1f750a5c-d820-42e1-9994-5858933e30b3.61db42aa-2c0a-47b6-bcd1-9c4eab3ca2ee","Height":434,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#654321","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20019.13510798886609689.38389766-90da-447d-9c5c-20167646d3ea.ff889bae-2bfb-404e-a89e-83c1d6f0a525","Height":558,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#654321","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52110.13510798886609689.7e47208d-7d9d-4a96-91c4-cd1da6300199.a8682484-8307-4fac-a9f0-1ab10e5f0dd0","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#654321","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41936.13510798886609689.5a1e13f4-f063-4721-8800-0c30cda46cfe.91ab148e-6343-4fda-95b3-337229c77752","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#654321","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63221.13510798886609689.aecf5298-ebed-4bb7-a5fa-6c509544fe0a.c132bb61-1d60-492c-9f13-322fb3983956","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#654321","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55378.13510798886609689.1def1893-96b1-4a0c-993a-9d716b815bbb.71e34ab0-0034-4257-b4eb-8fc7b11b33f6","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#654321","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["True-ProfitConstructionSo.SimpleEstimate_g1fh10y64rkcg"],"ContentIds":["4387aace-4ea0-84c8-6fba-2358d36e2a96","dc5f63f2-4ca4-2acf-63e6-fa64f748552d"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Do you need to create professional looking estimates and invoices and send them to your clients?\r\n\r\nAre you looking for a convenient way to manage and organize all of your estimates and invoices for all of your jobs?\r\n\r\nThe Working Contractor app helps you to stay on top of all of your jobs.

Allows you to draw on the canvas with the selected color. You can also clean drawing with a brush and get the color from the canvas. Choose the desired finished brush from different groups: static, dynamic, brush effects. Adjust the brush parameters - size, flow, spacing and more;\r\n* Tool \"Selection\". Allows you to select the desired area on the canvas and place it on different frames than quickly create an animation (for example, changing the position of the object or transparency). You can apply various effects to the selected area: blur, inversion, repaint to another color, and transform the object. It is possible to create your own brushes from the selected area;\r\n* The tool \"Crop\". Allows you to change the size of the canvas to arbitrary by selecting and adjusting the area. There are blanks of the sizes: 1х1, 2х3, 16х9;\r\n* Tool \"Camera\". You can create live photos, Stop motion animation, Timelapse video;\r\n* The tool \"Registrar\". It will help to create animated cards, live painting, captions for animation, movement or scaling of elements in animation.\r\n\r\nPLEASANT THINGS FOR CONVENIENCE\r\n* Undo/Redo/Clear actions. Cancel or repeat the actions on the canvas;\r\n* Copy/Paste. Allows you to copy the contents of the frame into memory, then paste on one frame, into individual frames or all at once, and also insert data as an object for the selection tool;\r\n* Symmetry. Allows you to speed up the process of drawing - mirror displays the contents;\r\n* Cycle management.  It makes it unnecessary to create additional frames to repeat. You can create an animation with an infinite repetition, boomerang and a certain number of repeats;\r\n* Backup projects. It makes backup copies of the workflow, thus preventing loss of data upon failure of the program: emergency shutdown, reboot the computer, etc.\r\n\r\nOPERATING MODES IN AMONTAGE\r\n* GIF animation mode. Allows you to export animation to GIF file;\r\n* Video mode. Allows you to export animation in video file format (*.avi, *.mp4);\r\n* The artist's mode. Allows you to concentrate on drawing the frame - removes all unnecessary from the interface and adjusts the program for drawing. Simplifies the work when creating a frame and animation in general.\r\n\r\nYOU'LL LIKE IT\r\n* Hotkeys. Designed to control playback and navigation by frames, quick selection of tools, saving, copy/paste, etc.;\r\n* Parameters of the frame. Framing allows you to draw the rest of the frames along the existing contour. Setting the frame repetition makes it unnecessary to create a copy of the frame for its delay during playback;\r\n* System of layers. Simplifies the process of drawing a frame, dividing the elements of the picture into different layers;\r\n* Timeline. Allows you to create, delete, duplicate frames. Select several frames, move them, clear them. When you select a frame, the canvas displays its contents;\r\n* Color palettes. The palette does not take up much space, is compact and includes all the necessary colors. If it necessary, changes to another color scheme;\r\n* Quick Access Palette. The palette is automatically formed in such a way that all the necessary colors are always right at hand;\r\n* Thematic palettes. We decided to regularly add various thematic palettes, which turned out to be a very useful and popular feature of the program.\r\n\r\nPOSSIBILITY OF IMPORT/EXPORT\r\n* Import images. Allows you to create animations from photos or from a set of images, make a slide show, add an image to the drawing animation;\r\n* Export PDF. You can export a PDF book, storyboard animation or as your own comics;\r\n* Export a set of images (sequence). Export each frame as an image in the specified format;\r\n* Export Speed painting video. You can get a speed painting video in one of the formats: *.avi, *.mp4;\r\n* Save/Open the project. Saves the workflow to a *.amp file and opens files of this format to continue working on the animation.\r\n\r\nSPECIAL ABILITIES\r\n* Settings of the program. You can simplify the work with the program by setting some parameters more convenient for yourself;\r\n* Scale and resize. It will help to create animations of the selected size, even in HD format;\r\n* Add background music. You can embellish video animation with background music;\r\n* Adding a watermark.

It uses two layers. You can import multiple photo's as well and draw over it. You can also add text.\r\n\r\nIt works like this:\r\n- Start filling the white bottom layer with fancy colors.\r\n- Next, press the button nearest to the left to show the black top layer.\r\n- When drawing, the black color is scratched away and the colors from the bottom layer become visible. You will create surprising pictures with this app!\r\n- When ready, save your drawing to the photo album and share it with your friends and family. The Save option can be found in the menu.\r\n \r\nOn the bottom layer, you can also press the spray can button for automatically producing colors. If you use this button, the “radiate” button will be available on the top layer. Press this “radiate” button and be amazed!\r\n\r\nExamples of other usages of this application:\r\n- Create your own Christmas or new years greeting card.\r\n- Use the white bottom layer only to create your drawings.\r\n- Press the \"spraycan\" button, go to the top layer and write a short message.\r\n- Draw a word or simple picture on the bottom layer, go to the top layer and let somebody guess what you have drawn by scratching lines.
