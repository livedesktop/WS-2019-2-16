That's where you come in.\n\nTacoma is a narrative adventure set aboard a high-tech space station in the year 2088. As you go about your mission, you'll explore every detail of how the station's crew lived and worked, finding the clues that add up to a gripping story of trust, fear, and resolve in the face of disaster.\n\nAt the heart of Tacoma is the facility's digital surveillance system, which has captured 3D recordings of pivotal moments in the crew's life on the station. As you explore, echoes of these captured moments surround you. You'll use your ability to rewind, fast-forward, and move through the physical space of these complex, interwoven scenes to examine events from every angle, reconstructing the multi-layered narrative as you explore.\n\nTacoma is the next game from the creators of Gone Home, and carries on that tradition of detailed, immersive, and powerful storytelling, while pulling players deeper into the narrative than ever before.\n\nFeatures:\n\n·\tA Richly Layered Story Experience: Six crewmembers lived and worked on space station Tacoma, forming relationships, experiencing love and loss, and facing crisis together. Discover not just what happened to these people, but what makes them who they are, through your role as an interactive investigator. The story is told through a series of fully voiced and animated interactive AR scenes, immersing you in the events on Tacoma.\n\n·\tA Groundbreaking Multi-Path Story System: In each section of the station, you are surrounded by digital representations of crewmembers following their own parallel story threads that diverge, recombine, and split off again. Rewind, fast-forward, and move through these scenes' chronologies as they swirl around you. Your interactive tools allow you to discover the tightly-knotted narrative from every angle, and in every detail.\n\n·\tA Deeply Interactive Gameworld: Explore Tacoma Station both physically and digitally. Unlock doors and drawers to find meaningful objects, notes, and physical artifacts, while simultaneously exploring extensive records of the crew's digital communications and personal thoughts. Every facet of the crew's experience on Tacoma is part of your investigation.\n\n·\tA Vision of the Future: Experience life in the year 2088. Discover a rich fictional universe that depicts humanity's expansion into low-Earth orbit and beyond. A deeply-imagined speculative vision of the near future from the award-winning story team behind Gone Home and BioShock 2: Minerva's Den.\n\n·\tA Compact Narrative Experience: Tacoma is estimated to take around 2 to 5 hours to complete. How deep you dig and how much detail you find is up to you. Tacoma is a non-combat, non-puzzle-focused game. The details of the story and gameworld are there for you to discover at your own pace.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9MZ3NZDHS1CD","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Living Legends: Wrath of the Beast","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24716.13877784344199341.c79618b4-1124-45f6-a440-cff5b38f9cbb.b7c6375a-4962-4121-b5a6-2a3605c74180","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9130.13877784344199341.c79618b4-1124-45f6-a440-cff5b38f9cbb.10d86503-6e5b-4998-8ad0-98a0e491b3a2","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61647.13877784344199341.c79618b4-1124-45f6-a440-cff5b38f9cbb.82fb5a1b-cdad-413d-bb57-a727078bfff0","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"$9.99","Price":9.99,"AverageRating":2.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["BigFishGames.LivingLegendsWrathoftheBeast_bsrvrvej7yy2w"],"ContentIds":["4a5e4598-166a-5894-858d-7c0332d9b0c9"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Big Fish Editor's Choice!

on real-world data. Take control of a whole country, like the USA, Germany, France, Russia, or Austria. Change laws, taxes and budgets based on real world statistics and data, and see what happens.\r\n\r\nThe game simulates a whole country: Population, debt, GDP, economic growth, unemployment, crime, life expectancy, birth rate, mortality rate, state of the infrastructure and so on. The player can adjust budgets, taxes, laws, and see what the outcome is. \r\n\r\nReal World Data\r\n\r\nThe game is running on real-world data. Meaning everything is based on real values: If you play as the USA, the debt, income, expenditures, crime rate, unemployment rate, etc. you start with is based on the actual, real values of the USA. For example if you lower a tax rate, you'll see what the simulation calculates as new values afterwards, in dollars, people, crimes per 100.000, interest rate, life expectancy in years, and similar.\r\n\r\nGameplay\r\n\r\nThere are goals to fulfill, like decreasing the crime rate or achieving a certain public health or education rating, but it is already interesting to try to tamper with the various options alone: What happens if you lower the minimum wage? What if you change the length of maternity leave? Or the retirement age? You can also do more serious changes like introducing censorship laws, compulsory military service, cash bans, or universal basic income.\r\n\r\nThere are military options, so you can start a war with any country in the world, and adjust its operation mode while the conflict is active. But be sure not to let it run out of control. Some countries for example also have a nuclear option, of course.\r\n\r\nThe game also includes a media and public relations system, where you can read the most interesting headlines, and try to influence the media with PR stunts, interviews, and similar. \r\n\r\nCountries\r\n\r\nYou can play as the USA, Germany, Russia, France, and Austria: These are the countries the simulation was implemented and tested to work nicely. But there are also additional countries and scenarios which can be downloaded. It is also possible to create new countries and scenarios on your own and share them with others.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH2S75F","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Prism","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10496.13510798884773464.31f0fda5-42d1-42c5-bb4c-1f84668c761b.313887b8-4711-4318-b461-e30c489d3d7b","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6695.13510798884773464.31f0fda5-42d1-42c5-bb4c-1f84668c761b.0ae289ba-eaaa-4326-8fa4-2c01533bb44f","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"$59.99","Price":59.99,"AverageRating":4.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["NCHSoftware.Prism_7kedsbyvzns34"],"ContentIds":["c124b2b4-49a7-043b-6ff5-7f7601fd012f"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Prism is a stable and comprehensive multi-format video file converter.

Check Print'R will automatically generate the word amount so you do not have to worry about spelling it out. You can also print blank checks to take with you. \r\n\r\nLayouts can be saved and loaded separately. Each bank has its own personalized layout.\r\n\r\nMulti-account, switch instantly.\r\n\r\nDrop the picture of your signature onto Check Print'R, and it will sign your checks automatically. \r\n\r\nAll elements of the check can be moved to perfectly fit your needs, and you can decide which elements will be printed (convenient for pre-printed paper). \r\n\r\nAdd up to 9 pictures to your checks for elaborate layout.\r\n\r\nPrint as many blank checks as you want to use them like regular checkbooks.\r\n\r\nExtremely accurate MICR E13B technology is used to print special characters at the bottom of checks so they are recognized by bank processing. This font is used daily by regional and nationals banks.\r\n\r\nKeep track of all your expenses and deposits with the built-in electronic record book (Register). Balance is calculated automatically. Reconcile with your bank statement just as easily as you would with a paper record book. Save, load data and settings to use different accounts. Set different fonts to print your name on checks.\r\n\r\nPrint immediately or later, on top, middle, bottom, or three checks per page. Checks can be printed on regular letter-size paper, plain white or color, as well as on professional looking check refill paper available from fine office supply stores. Also, Versacheck #1000, #1001, #1002, #3000, and Personal # 3001.\r\n\r\nThe height of checks can be set in Preferences, to accommodate non standard pre-printed paper.\r\n\r\nPrinting can be nudged horizontally and vertically very precisely in 1/72th inches.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT :\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nCheck Print'R is meant for personal productivity. For uses like payroll or other corporate use, better look towards other, specialized applications.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, the MICR E13B font used in this application has been purchased by regional and national banks for their own use, after stringent tests. We are absolutely confident they will perform perfectly when used correctly. However, it is necessary to strictly follow these principles :\r\n\r\n1 - It is paramount never to use \"scale to fit\". Printing must be done at 100% to insure the MICR printing conforms to standard.\r\n\r\n2 - MICR Toner (magnetic ink) is mandatory to meet the American Banking Association MICR E13B standard and U.S. law (Check 21 Act). MICR E13B printing complies with ANSI X9.27-1995, ANSI X9.100-160-1-2009, and Canadian CPA006 standards.\r\n\r\nAlthough many banks today use Optical Character Recognition which accepts any ink, some are equipped with readers that require magnetic ink, and will be suspicious of checks printed with ordinary ink.\r\n\r\nMICR toner is indistinguishable of regular black toner, and can be acquired from fine office supply stores, Amazon, or other Internet toner vendors.\r\n\r\nIf you still have questions, or if you encounter any difficulties using this app, please use the support link to contact us, we will do all we can to help right away.\r\n\r\nYou can print the accompanying letter together with the check (Voucher) with Check Writer III, also available in the Windows Store.","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NQ9SFDHBXLK","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Panoramic Landscapes","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59832.13777613854529434.d6d148a7-17a2-4dbe-89e3-78226094cc02.2f0201c5-a44a-402d-9203-829e8ad0ad92","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"$0.99","Price":0.99,"AverageRating":4.2,"RatingsCount":"11","PackageFamilyNames":["Microsoft.PanoramicLandscapes_8wekyb3d8bbwe"],"ContentIds":["1e7b39db-a82c-8c1d-6793-d5a575e295a5"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Mountains and beaches and forests, oh my!

Contains typing games.\r\n\r\nTyping Fingers uses a completely new approach to teach the efficient touch-typing (ten-fingers) system. It makes typing fun, is interactive and works with modern technologies and a new teaching method. The beautiful design and peaceful music create an amazing atmosphere that allows everybody, including children, to improve their typing skills and get TYPING FINGERS DIPLOMA after  successful completion of all levels.\r\n\r\n*** SYMMETRIC SUPER LEARNING ***\r\nTyping Fingers uses a modern teaching approach based on brain analysis. The SYMETRIC method helps to activate both  brain hemispheres equally in the process of learning and playing the game. The user maps the keyboard symmetrically and symmetrical patterns are repeated again and again during the whole game.\r\n\r\n*** GET A TYPING FINGERS DIPLOMA *** \r\nWin the game and get Foriero's Typing Fingers diploma! You can get exactly the same diploma as you see on the screen shots except with your name and date of game completion. Just print it and stick it on the wall and everybody, even you, will be proud that you have successfully completed TYPING FINGERS.\r\n\r\n*** 32 LEVELS WITH INTERACTIVE TUTOR ***\r\n(In-App Purchase is required for 31 of levels) \r\nIn all the 32 lessons a \"Tutor\" called \"Dennis\" will help you to learn which fingers are for striking which keys. The levels are built up gradually, so you learn how to use your keyboard in a fun and easy way.\r\n\r\n*** LEARNING AND PLAYING MODE ***\r\nEach lesson is divided into two parts. The first one is for learning purposes. In this part Dennis helps you to memorize letters and symbols and to practise the correct motion.\r\n\r\nThe second part is a game and you have \"ONLY\" three lives to beat the level. Work diligently, ardently and persistently and you´ll get it!\r\n\r\n*** WRITE US ***\r\nIf you have any ideas or notions or just feelings on how to improve this\r\napp you can always press the WRITE US button in the game and send us your feedback and wishes. We will be very glad to incorporate all your input into a new version.\r\n\r\nThank you","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9P4XKD9ZV34F","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Spreadsheets for Microsoft Excel","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34905.14580273318981398.32d70def-4976-4817-b012-98fb1885f58a.b52fe35c-f4a5-439d-b6aa-2a709d9cf593","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#f2f2f2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.43366.14580273318981398.677805b4-5408-414e-8c0f-32a83df06257.338cce74-5c1b-44da-9a45-561b61294873","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#f2f2f2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"StrikethroughPrice":"$14.99","DisplayPrice":"$7.99","Price":7.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["15799Dinebulla.SpreadsheetsforMicrosoftExcel_hb0h1tr5399ja"],"ContentIds":["c74d70f4-db31-6c67-972a-089d9c9818d4","2a13cf7f-5050-5efc-7915-9eef2738e49f"],"Badges":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V3.ProductBadge, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","StyleKey":"Default","Text":"SAVE $7.00","Type":"Merchandized"}],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Templates for Microsoft Excel app is the design solutions for your Excel spreadsheets.

paint program currently specialized in Eastern ink painting. It features important breakthroughs in recent history of digital painting technology: 1. 3D brushes allowing expressive strokes as if done wielding a real brush. 2. Truly natural ink (watercolor) flows giving you the charm of water-based media. 3. Vector-like 12k output with raster richness.\r\n\r\nThe development traces back to 1999 when Computer Graphics researcher Nelson Chu started to devise a novel method to simulate a brush in 3D. By wielding such a virtual brush, you can make vastly different marks which normally require switching between many 'brushes' in other programs. By eliminating explicit switching you can finally make expressive marks that capture your rhythm.\r\n\r\nWater-based media have always been a challenge in digital painting technology. Many paint programs offer 'watercolor brushes', most of which are based on local diffusion or stamping scanned images. Nice results can be achieved but something important is missing - the fluidity. Our paint simulation, on the other hand, brings digital watercolor to a whole new level by using Computational Fluid Dynamics for natural flows. The use of GPU makes such a simulation fast enough for real-time interaction, even on a tablet computer.\r\n\r\nFinally, the simulation is paired with a new rendering method that gives you both raster richness and vector-like output up to 12k resolution. You can export your artwork with alpha channel to your favorite image editor for further processing.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nPlease note that Expresii requires a good GPU to run smoothly. Not every system does have the right hardware so please try before you buy. If you encounter issue, please contact us at support@expresii.com before giving a bad review. We will try out best to help troubleshoot with you. Sometimes it's really the GPU hardware or the driver behaving incorrectly, not our app. We have over a dozen systems spanning different hardware and OS combinations of Windows 7, 8, 10, and nvidia, AMD or Intel GPU, and Expresii works fine on all of them. Some of you may say your other paint programs don't have issue on your systems - but please note that Expresii uses OpenGL and many other programs don't. It is possible to encounter issue when you enable GPU support even in some big-brand creative suites. \r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n2017.09.23 Notice: Due to an exclusive license agreement we entered with an animation production company, from now on when you download and use Expresii, you have to the agree with the following statement: \r\nYou are not allowed to use the software for creating feature animated film during the period 1 October 2017 to 1 September 2019.

AIFF, or Apple Lossless, and find that Windows is unable to play them?  Batch Music Converter is designed to help you quickly convert your existing music collection into a format that is supported natively under Windows. The conversion is done in three easy steps: \r\n\r\nStep 1: Select the folder that contains the existing music collection. \r\nStep 2: Select the folder that will contain the newly converted music collection. \r\nStep 3: Select encoding method and settings, and start the batch conversion. \r\n\r\nSince Windows 8 would suspend apps in the background, please keep the app in full screen or snapped view mode (i.e., running on the left or right side of the screen) when doing a long conversion.\r\n\r\nThe FREE version allows conversions up to 100 files at a time.  In-app purchase is required to remove this limit.","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDQMNN","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Voice Recorder Application","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6889.9007199266661711.e184bd98-e1b5-419d-a326-eac501920b73.91290918-ceda-4488-8869-42bb6aa0026c","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17266.9007199266661711.5c1296c3-3358-4e6a-a6b5-1b7af9b56a64.00b44f80-8ac6-43a7-9aac-e2090c574f9b","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"$38.99","Price":38.99,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["39822Milad-WindowsDevelop.VoiceRecorderApplication_p9atyhwmzw5aj"],"ContentIds":["e4053b9f-acc4-3a02-3201-faf125fe7612"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"This Application require microphone in order to access most of the feature where you are asked to enable your microphone.
