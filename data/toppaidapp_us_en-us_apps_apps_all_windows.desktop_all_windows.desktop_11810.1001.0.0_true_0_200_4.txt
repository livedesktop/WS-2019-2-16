It is implemented through USB3, Intel i5/i7 CPU, 3 infrared night vision cameras on Kinect sensor, 4/8G of ram (preferred) and state of art most advanced human body detection Kinect 2 technology. The little toy security cameras you got from market come nowhere close to this system. And it got a much bigger area of detection than most motion sensor\r\n\r\nYou specify when the house should be empty. when your kids should be back from school at the end of no people time period. Then you got a text and email with image that your kid got home. How sweet that feeling could be during your busy work afternoon. If after 15 minutes of end time, your kids do not come in house, you also got a text/email to check on kids, if the bus is running late, if they go to friend’s house…. \r\nYou will get text (with SMS plan) and email alerts with image if human body is detected during no people time period you specified. The sensor can cover much big area than most motion sensor and unlike motion sensor, won’t be tricked by your dog running by.\r\nWhen this App is first installed, user should start with clicking the Step 1: Sensor Setting button to setup alert send to email, house no people time period, (specify start and end time), if you have kid comes back to house at the above specified end time, you can specify if you want an email and text (if texting plan is purchased) to be sent to let you know kid has come home. You can also specify if you want an email / text (if purchased) alert sent to you if kid does not come home 15 minutes after specified end time.  User can also specify number of people limit after no people time detected by sensor. This can let you know when kid got visitor. User can get up to 30 alert emails with captured images attached for the above specified alert condition each day. after that, text only emails will be sent for that day. Please note: emails can be delayed or filtered by your receiving email server. Testing shows that our email sending server will work better with yahoo or Gmail, while tend to got blocked by outlook.com email server. So for fast prompt notifications, please consider purchasing our SMS texting plan.\r\n\r\nUser can view Kinect monitor real time image remotely when logged in with the same Microsoft account by clicking the View Kinect Image Remotely button. Kinect sensor images will be downloaded to your computer at every 1 minute per image and will be saved and only saved on your local computer. User has options to view past images by selecting different time span. User can delete image one by one or click Delete All Images button. Each image size and Total saved images numbers are displayed so please regularly clear images to release disk space based on your computer disk space. When running in this remote image view mode, not in Windows focus, but in background, images sometimes may not be loaded at every minutes due to your computer system resource allocation. Click to resume focus will get the every minute back on track. So this system is also good for you to see what your pet up to during the whole time span while you are out while the security camera approach can only give a moment at a certain time.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: The App are provided as is without any guarantees or warranty. \r\nAlthough the developer has attempted to find and correct any bugs in the App,  the developer is not responsible for any damage or losses of any kind caused by the use or misuse of the App.\r\n\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4QCPR","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"IPv4/v6 Subnet Calculator","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24485.13510798887392526.9cf864ee-014a-43d2-9107-84338bc55553.29e73cf5-4c68-4251-8fcf-c98615953359","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37103.13510798887392526.fe4b75ee-e82b-43b6-b461-a99113964b6d.ce757985-a163-43a1-b183-a9f512947ced","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18615.13510798887392526.9782efa4-68a6-4865-a514-24054aca224e.b3303a01-4404-4800-bfb9-5e6b044d5944","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31176.13510798887392526.8b039131-1646-47df-b866-1e33485609cc.da89fdda-77a9-4ebd-b4ba-218f8d9ec234","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39700.13510798887392526.4c93bc59-6f2d-4337-8155-2f70a34d3bb6.1e7819b3-603c-494f-b3b4-21b10c865bac","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56921.13510798887392526.78f2a1ed-5046-4ae3-a89c-79bce81fe46d.5d699b78-be26-4d53-91cd-61f7cdee79bd","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"$5.49","Price":5.49,"AverageRating":4.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["35257CampbellMobileApps.IPv4v6SubnetCalculator_wf8zhwqbpzmmy"],"ContentIds":["7bb7fc8d-0824-81b4-9dc1-2307789ba088"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Use IPv4/v6 Subnet Calculator to perform precise calculations fast and easily for IP Subnetting, CIDR, Supernetting, and VLSM.

For various credit cards, online-banking, security-token, email accounts and so on? \r\n\r\niPIN - and your PINs and passwords are always at hand. \r\n\r\nYour professional password manager on the go and at home: access at lightning speed, as secure as possible and also in sync via WiFi Sync at any time with your Android, Windows, Mac and iOS devices. \r\n\r\nThe highlight: login with the sensor keyboard \r\n\r\nWith an innovative sensor keyboard you'll have quick access to all your PINs - without any annoying and time-killing passwords. Just remember a geometrical shape, a digit, an alphabetic character or an individual sensor combination and set up your private sensor code. \r\n\r\nYou can simply touch a sensor or swipe across multiple sensors at once. Naturally, combinations are allowed and should be used to make your sensor code as secure as possible. The first touch activates the sensor, and with a second touch the sensor becomes deactivated. You can activate and deactivate the sensors as often as you like. Your individual sensor code is calculated by the order in which you have activated and deactivated the sensors and in which way the sensors have been activated and deactivated: single touch or swipe. \r\n\r\nSecurity \r\n\r\nSecurity is of greatest importance! All data (including the data in iCloud if you enable iCloud synchronisation in iPIN) is encrypted with the Advanced Encryption Standard and a key length of 256 bit (abbreviated AES-256). With this state-of-the-art encryption algorithm your private data is protected from unauthorized access - even in the case your device gets into the wrong hands. \r\n\r\nKISS - keep it simple and secure \r\n\r\niPIN tries to fulfill the KISS principle. iPIN was developed to store and display PINs and passwords - no more and no less. So the focus is on simplicity, clarity and high level of security. \r\n\r\nPlease don't hesitate to contact us regarding any questions, comments or feature requests - just send an email to iPIN@ibilities.com. \r\n\r\nVisit www.ibilities.com for more detailed information. \r\n\r\nYou think this App is useful? Well, write a review or tell it a friend :-) \r\n\r\nHave a lot of fun with iPIN!","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH59225","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Simple Carb Counter","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36302.13510798886914582.99851abf-b7fd-43f6-9e2f-b0748d305cce.817da287-98ea-46b1-95a4-6664ab0013ac","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28481.13510798886914582.8c74901f-aeda-40a1-9139-3c6cb66ef015.203ebf82-6330-4cb1-b6ff-812cc46acc8e","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2623.13510798886914582.5081c4b0-275d-49df-836f-f49151c4bad6.a9d2f7aa-7cda-4144-b54f-82003a739c16","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34664.13510798886914582.55292e82-c755-4ae9-a73d-62f297df5ce9.b54d3a58-194f-4e5d-88b9-ea39d719aef1","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40520.13510798886914582.887ab3f3-fc1d-41c3-95c5-57645e44be61.4ec05d24-d7f5-462e-b112-b9578f933569","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5240.13510798886914582.869c4395-8420-4ba1-8162-2a2791f8d6f6.812e2f8f-def3-4e11-9832-6738c86954c7","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33056.13510798886914582.424ee1d0-10ba-4e33-986c-a25310dc4f3d.1ab4eec5-6804-4c91-9ddf-a51e7e33d797","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38967.13510798886914582.e0d2a2da-6e1d-4185-adae-044b29a03605.7a2ecec4-0aea-4b25-8f7c-693babcc56c7","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38862.13510798886914582.ead445de-4151-462a-926e-0b7266ddaeb0.a9da6d20-7574-4708-af6d-49b34d46c228","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"$1.49","Price":1.49,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["42247xpistou.SimpleCarbCounter_f4r7jwhgny9q2"],"ContentIds":["75817d41-93c9-cb48-ee45-cad74384ab1c"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Are you looking to log all the excruciating details of that last piece of lettuce that you just ate?

- Use Loci to Link In Your Mind. See https://iform.us. Loci is a method of loci mixed reality mind mapping application located in a virtual reality memory palace. It combines the method of loci memory technique and 3D mixed reality interaction with mind maps (graphs) to support you on your personal analysis tasks. These tasks can include looking for an apartment, finding out more about a disease, or deciding on a next job.  Features initial import capability using \"Load Graph\" voice command for MindManager, Freemind, and GraphML format files.\r\n\r\nWhy - Loci uses three core concepts to help you organize, understand and remember; mind maps let you break a problem down into component parts to organize and do analysis, mixed reality interaction with mind maps lets you visualize in 3D to understand how they are related, and the method of loci persistent placement of mind map nodes lets you improve your recall of the mind map, even when you are not using the Loci software.  In this way you can organize your problem, understand it, and remember it later when you need to use that information for decisions.\r\n\r\nHow - Loci is built for the Microsoft Mixed Reality. Loci supports spatial mapping so you can place nodes from your mind maps in relevant locations in your memory palace. Loci uses voice, gaze and gestures to enable you to make your 3D graphs (mind maps). You start by saying \"add node\" to make a node representing the problem you are working on, then you look at this node and again say \"add node\" to add more nodes for attributes of the problem, so you have a visualization of your problem. You can say \"load image\" to add nodes with images from files. You can link nodes together to show how they are related to each other. To load and save mind maps you use File Explorer or OneDrive. To help you understand how Loci works, it has a seven day free trial.\r\n\r\nWhere - Where you place and do things is very important to your memory.  Locations in your memory palace are important to you. They have meaning that you effectively recall, and with Loci you can combine your visual and spatial memory.\r\n\r\nWhen - Loci helps you on longer term problems you are working on, where you need to apply your capabilities for cognition. You may return to these problems over a span of weeks or months to arrive at the right decision. You use Loci when you have set aside time to do deep analysis at home or work.\r\n\r\nWho - If you are solving complex problems, producing complex things, or planning or purchasing complex items or services, such as cars, houses, college, stocks, or medical treatment, you could benefit by organizing, understanding, and remembering your information by using Loci to link in your mind.

This tool enables you to create highly-detailed lists of tasks and includes all the tools and functions you need to manage your time and pending work more effectively.One of the features of MyPlan that caught my attention was that you can select to install it as a desktop app or use it as a standalone program, saving preferences to an db file.

The app is suitable for all age groups and skill levels. You can be a beginner, intermediate or advanced typist. Even if you took typing classes before, but it never sank in, Type Fu will help you refresh your skills and take them to the next stage instantly.\r\n\r\n• PACKED WITH ENGAGING EXERCISES. Type Fu is fun to use! Exercises vary from simple letters, numbers and words to proverbs and quotes of great thinkers of the past. Basic exercises are generated programatically so that you will never see the same exercise twice.\r\n\r\n• MULTIPLE LEVELS OF DIFFICULTY. Should you start from the very beginning, or do you want to just polish your type-fu a tad? Figure out your initial skill level and start practicing right away, until your fingers are a blur!\r\n\r\n• MULTIPLE KEYBOARD LAYOUTS. The app can be configured for use with any European or American keyboard layout such as Qwerty, Dvorak, Colemak, Qwertz or Azerty (including regional variants).\r\n\r\n• ADAPTIVE. Type Fu is smart: when you are making an outstanding progress, it can automatically increase the level of difficulty to keep you on your toes while improving the skill.\r\n\r\n• VISUAL AND AUDIO HINTS. Type Fu assists in a non-obtrusive way. Various indications of hitting or missing the right keys are helpful, pertinent, don't get in the way and can be disabled.\r\n\r\n• EASY PROGRESS TRACKING. Type Fu helps you perfecting the skill of touch typing by visualizing your progress. You will be able to easily tell from the pretty charts exactly how much better your typing speed and accuracy become, and which keys your miss most.\r\n\r\n• FULLY INTEGRATED WITH WINDOWS 10. Get the top-notch user experience. Type Fu supports HiDPI displays, works offline, and updates automatically.\r\n\r\n• PAY ONCE, USE ANYTIME AND ANYWHERE. The app does not require recurring payments and constant network connection unlike online typing tutors. Once you pay for it, it's yours forever.\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NP281NJ9ZTX","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"My Spreadsheet Editor","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13555.13727136531094929.eae8a690-d9b5-47ef-bbf0-1a1dce322fbd.5d076ec2-e395-4ebb-9486-9156bc5955aa","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25270.13727136531094929.1598aa42-5c48-4e5b-9848-0cffad8d0733.f8ce8a78-24a2-4b24-a6ba-c69a773eedfd","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19955.13727136531094929.b73002f6-872c-4e61-9d6f-432cfe2c80bb.560067c2-1604-4a45-bedc-213a2d097826","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"$0.99","Price":0.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["TusharKoshti.MySpreadsheetEditor_8xyfwj0nb922c"],"ContentIds":["1ba9e46e-2684-446d-37e8-4e8f82c32496","a3839906-846e-7578-af56-d2a15641695f"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"My Spreadsheet Editor is a great app to manage your spreadsheet files from your PC or Windows Mobile.

Especially if you have to sum the hours and minutes, or if to associate the time with other indicators.\r\n\r\nIf you want to calculate the cost of timed services, knowing the rate of hour cost or the supply of fuel for gasoline generator for 2 hours and 45 minutes, Time Calculator TC2017 is your assistant.\r\n\r\nFor example: How long you have worked, if within 5 days spent 2 hours and 20 minutes every day? If to use a simple calculator it will be \"2.20 x 5 =\" 11. But this is a mistake! It should be 11 hours and 40 minutes!\r\n\r\nThe proposed calculator will make it easy to provide different calculations between different indicators, considering the fact that one hour has 60 minutes.\r\nThere is no surprise today in addition and subtraction of hours and minutes.\r\n\r\nUnlike other similar calculators, the user can choose the kind of numbers that will be used for calculations (number, time, speed, distance, cost, fuel, consumption, rate). The information of measures will show up on displays for convenience (consumption in liters/hour, speed in km/h etc.).\r\n\r\nIt is possible to calculate quickly the work time for the day. For example, work started at 7:25pm and finished 3:40am (7:25pm~3:40am=8:15).\r\n\r\nIt is possible immediately multiply the result by the rate per hour (assume $750), we obtain the sum $6187.50 (8:15 * $750 =$6187.15).\r\n\r\nIt should also be noted that there are two main approaches for approximation the result, calculating the cost of services based on rate of hour.\r\n\r\nIn the \"accounting approximation\" [Acc.] the time value is approximating immediately after conversion from the format \"hours and minutes\" to format \"hours and hundredths of hours\".\r\n\r\nExample: 3:05 (3 hours 5 minutes) * $1000 = $3080 (first 5/60=0,0833333, the value is approximating to 0.08, then the time in hundredths of hours (3.08) multiplied by $1000 = $3080).\r\n\r\nIn the \"mathematical approximation\" [Mat.] it is done after calculations.\r\n\r\nExample: 3:05 (3 hours 5 minutes) * $1000 = $3083.33 (first 5/60=0,0833333 that time in fractional hours 3.0833333 multiplied by $1000 = $3083.33).\r\nCalculator can help here as well. It is possible to change the approximation mode with the simple press of a button.\r\n\r\nAnother example. Estimated time of operation is 35 hours and 20 minutes. Given the estimated savings of 5% will receive 33 hours 34 min (35:20 5%=33:34).\r\n\r\nMore detailed information about the logic operation of the calculator of time on the website, go to that by clicking [?].","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NSM0WSRKSQ7","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Simplified!

If your aim is to make video presentations for websites like Youtube, this is the app to invest in. It has all the features you could hope for in an advanced teleprompter yet it is almost free. \r\n\r\nThe script box, or area where the running content displays, can be adjusted in size and moved to just about any location within the video preview area. If it is placed over your eyes, your viewers will assume that you are looking at them in the eye as you speak. If it is reduced in size, they will not be able to detect your eye movements, making you appear to be speaking spontaneously.\r\n\r\nVideoprompter makes it easy to deliver natural and compelling monologues, even if you don't have any experience in public speaking.\r\n\r\nYou can also control the size of the font, the rate at which the script runs across the box, or activate face detection if this helps you keep more focused. Video files can be saved in the Avi, Mp4 or Wmv formats. \r\n\r\nAll these features are accessible through a row of buttons that are conveniently located along the bottom of the screen. Because they are away from the front-facing camera, hand movements will not be captured in the video, should you wish to make any adjustments during a recording session.\r\n\r\nVideoprompter has a 24-hour trial period and then a price of $2.49. We encourage honest ratings and reviews.

without CNC programming or the need for a CAD or CAM program. CNCL makes it easy to precisely turn a radius or a taper, grind drills and mills, broach a gear, knurl (cut) a shaft, do any pitch (high precision) multi start threading, turn a spur gear or pulley cutter, simply by setting a few parameters. No complex calculations needed, all you need are the dimensions of the part to turn. The build in tool change and tool library let you select a tool and continue without the need for adjusting positions. Change from Metric to Inches by a click on a button. Backlash compensation is implemented, no need to fit ball screws. For repetitive tasks, a record and play-back function is available. The recorded GCodes can be saved for use on other types of controllers. A manual is built-in and can be printed. \r\n\r\nCNCL is touch optimized to run on a small 7\" tablet. The supported controller is GRBL version 1.1 (or compatible), a free open source controller based on affordable Arduino hardware. The controller can be connected by USB, Bluetooth or a (wireless) network.  \r\n\r\nIf you ever wanted to start with CNC, this is the easy and affordable way to do it. \r\n\r\nTrial version: \r\nCNCL is provided as a 30 days trial version. The trial version is a full version without any limitations. After expiration of the trial version you can buy the app and an annual subscription. \r\n\r\nApp: \r\nTo use CNCL after the trial period you need to buy the app and an annual subscription. Without a valid annual subscription, you can’t use the CNCL app except for buying the annual subscription. \r\n\r\nAnnual subscription: \r\nWithin the app (license screen) you can buy an annual subscription for € 1,99. This subscription entitles you to use the CNCL app and all new releases without any limitations within the subscription period. \r\n\r\nYou can cancel the subscription at any time to avoid further charges. \r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

The application could reduce the size of Video to 100 MB, 150MB, 50 MB and etc.\r\n\r\nIn order to use the application, just specify the size of the video in MB that you want to achieve and it will compress the video to that size.The compressed video will be saved as a new video on the computer.\r\n\r\nThere are various places where reducing the Video size helps.For example, in emails the attachment sizes are limited to 25 MB.In such cases the large videos could be compressed to 25 MB and sent across emails.\r\n\r\nSmaller sized videos also help to upload them to a website and could be transferred easily using file sharing services and pen drives.If you are a website owner, you could offer different sizes of the same video to your customers.This will help them to download the video as per their requirements. \r\n\r\nThe compressed videos also help to save the space on phone, harddisk or the pen drives wherever they are used.\r\n\r\nThe application supports MP4 and WMV file formats.","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9P549Q73LQ6D","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Bitcoin Mining Made Easy","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.16239.14576470085727679.ced60c58-707d-4cd7-b09a-35423926099b.fc9e383e-55de-4c3d-b9c8-fd8800fe06fb","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7609.14576470085727679.3d62de94-243a-41d7-84b4-c34656daa6d6.4480f049-86dc-42bd-b7d3-086b303a9044","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23687.14576470085727679.f078ff95-72a2-44d9-94d0-1f470b495f46.faa26f73-3c1b-4afa-9c79-653bffc6b7a9","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38006.14576470085727679.d1aa8fea-be17-4dfb-ae1b-6d7f6224e883.0d2af3ea-13d0-46fe-b4a1-3dd1082f6e5e","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29130.14576470085727679.4bf1468a-a8dd-4974-897f-02731f73238a.b0f6213a-6131-472a-a1f4-c093dc674529","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34194.14576470085727679.cc9cb7dd-6ffc-4812-a736-8a736ffd014a.93afc390-c70a-4e9d-b292-487a6fa9330a","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"$5.99","Price":5.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["8635ApproachApplications.BitcoinMiningMadeEasy_jnpw9xmhc8mta"],"ContentIds":["bcf81f6c-1c3c-00f6-e79b-18d7a54fe77d"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"How Bitcoin Mining Works:\r\nWhere do bitcoins come from? With paper money, a government decides when to print and distribute money. Bitcoin doesn't have a central government.\r\n\r\nWith Bitcoin, miners use special software to solve math problems and are issued a certain number of bitcoins in exchange. This provides a smart way to issue the currency and also creates an incentive for more people to mine.\r\n\r\nThis app has over 200 guides which will fully explain just how Bitcoin works and how you can mine Bitcoins in the comfort of your own home.\r\n\r\nGuides include\r\nHow Much Can I Make Mining Bitcoin\r\nAntminer R4 Performance\r\nAntminer R4 Unboxing and Setup -

Go to our Tutorials page and see for yourself how easy it is for anyone to do with just a few simple steps. Download our Try-Before-You-Buy demo and use it on your own photos!\r\n\r\nChange image aspect rate without distortion.\r\nIntelligent Resizer (iResizer) allows you to \"fix\" the aspect ratio of a photo. Want to change from 4:3 to 16:9? No problem, iResizer folds the image so that it will still look natural and will retain the quality, integrity and spirit of the original! In order to preserve important objects you simply select them and run the resizing, the rest is done automatically.\r\n\r\nChange the spacing between main objects.\r\nToo bad! The main objects of the scene are separated with a long and boring empty space. If you can change the composition so that both objects would be next to each other - great! But what if you can't? Well, you still can change spacing between objects with iResizer. It gently \"folds\" the picture making unnecessary spacing go away. You don't need any precise editing; just mark both objects you want to put closer, set the desired resolution and enjoy a spectacular result!\r\n\r\nCreate square images for Instagram without cropping.\r\nInstagram accepts only square photos, and trying to upload hundreds of 4:3 photos can be a pain. With iResizer you can easily create 1:1 photo without cropping in two steps: first, mark areas on the photo you want to preserve, and run Instagram resizing!\r\n\r\nRemove objects from image like you'd fold a paper photo.\r\nGoofy persons spoiling group portraits, background wreckage and garbage, unwanted landscape objects - make all of them disappear with iResizer. The application concertinas your photo so that undesired objects will be overlapped by other parts of the photo. This is just like you'd fold a paper photo, but with digital images. And thanks to smart algorithms inside, the final resized photo looks completely natural, while the process doesn't require any special skills!","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PL02DWNHT0C","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Lyrics and Chords Manager","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39428.14257129753177776.96ffd13a-61f2-4f4e-b2c9-2a50e09f3037.7152c250-8b9c-4572-b256-4c6e6b47e926","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#007ACC","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34167.14257129753177776.b750f018-8155-49f6-ab89-2532568652bb.080db6b1-7412-425b-bfcb-ac021966fdfe","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#007ACC","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29124.14257129753177776.e51e41cf-0c11-4118-bd51-db57831d8b4d.c1a6dae3-27b5-4747-9165-374af3e3c190","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#007ACC","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"$5.99","Price":5.99,"AverageRating":4.6,"RatingsCount":"5","PackageFamilyNames":["42336PurpleWizard.MusicPrompter_cn7xt1bj5zpzw"],"ContentIds":["0fc8fc3e-f72a-900b-acef-f059b41a6fe1","4d818ec4-8b34-2613-bc4a-29c5df7ddfd8"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Lyrics and Chords Manager is the new name for Music Prompter.

Control your SqueezeBox players from your Windows 10 device.\r\nThis app controls Squeezebox players connected to a Logitech Media Server (Squeezebox Server) or MySqueezebox.com (including the server in the SqueezeBox Touch). Replicates almost every function of a Squeezebox Controller with an interface optimize for a touch screen and mouse control.\r\n\r\nTrial Mode is limited to one day and is fully functional.\r\n\r\nRequirements: Logitech Media Server version 7.7 or better (tested with versions up to 7.8). Use the latest version if you plan on using MySqueezebox.com too. A MySqueezebox.com account is required if you don't use a Squeezebox Server. You can create one from within the app or on the website. And of course Squeezebox players to control.   \r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Replicates almost all of the functionality of a SqueezeBox Controller, including the context menus and plugin apps.\r\n- Incremental list loading for fast navigation through the menus.\r\n- Works with both MySqueezebox.com and Logitech Media Server (Squeezebox Server) as the music source.\r\n- Automatic server discovery.\r\n- Customizable backgrounds for each player.\r\n- Works with multiple servers, players can be switched between servers.\r\n- Song Downloading - download songs from your server to the device.\r\n- Player Manager for easy syncing/unsyncing of players.\r\n- Customizable Home menu.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- By default, Windows Store apps are prevented from connecting to servers running on the same machine as the app. You can exempt an app from this.  You can learn more about this here: https://github.com/tiagonmas/Windows-Loopback-Exemption-Manager\r\n- This app can be quite demanding on the server compared to other controller apps and as such may not work well with a server running on a NAS.\r\n\r\n- Use a wifi connection if possible. A mobile data connection would work if the server is setup correctly, but the performance may not be acceptable.\r\n\r\n- This app requires a persistent connection with the server. If you're using a mobile data connection, this may incur a significant data usage fee.\r\n\r\n- Tested with the SqueezeBox Receiver, Boom.","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDDCCL","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Decision Making Wheel","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.11906.9007199266382127.eed13888-3da4-4bbe-b57f-21eafa534840.7bb9be48-309e-489e-85bd-f9caa7684a01","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.11026.9007199266382127.80d048c0-8d60-490e-9e16-34471fb4a24c.2cf3ac9d-af54-4d9e-bdeb-8ec24b47d492","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.21152.9007199266382127.62a3bd4b-55e6-41c0-a365-2a2bc0fe3cdc.b5fa87f5-2eb1-4ca2-942c-ad823548ffcc","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.54760.9007199266382127.1556e001-77de-4741-8394-62d5ac166fe6.d71e142e-473b-40a8-84ec-922d3d7093b0","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.12659.9007199266382127.f60d5f12-da5e-4bbe-b872-9b8d05a7b683.c968057a-95e6-4315-b7dd-7401bd1d72cf","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.9974.9007199266382127.eaf66bde-6a9e-4f08-bebe-e6b942c5631e.ca8c9b0d-6190-4d27-b258-7bfd1f41a765","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41617.9007199266382127.40b30308-aefa-47a1-9ec3-2ca78411e0ad.57c8f28d-8a00-4898-a93d-ba2ed5a7ed51","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"$1.99","Price":1.99,"AverageRating":3.3,"RatingsCount":"36","PackageFamilyNames":["6897MaxtoreApps.DecisionMakingWheel_3s6k9m0tnzkcj"],"ContentIds":["87bf5601-760c-9bfc-1c0c-fccc68e10247"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"The Decision Making Wheel is the best way to make decisions you don't want to or when it is hard to choose from similar options.

It covers the same topics as the award winning game DragonBox Algebra 5+, but moves on to cover more advanced topics in mathematics and algebra. It also includes practice tasks that allow students to practice specific types of algebraic operations.\r\n\r\nDragonBox Algebra 12+ covers the following algebraic concepts:\r\n\r\n* Addition\r\n* Division\r\n* Multiplication\r\n* Parentheses\r\n* Positive and Negative signs\r\n* Addition of Fractions (Common Denominators)\r\n* Collection of Like Terms\r\n* Factorization\r\n* Substitution\r\n\r\nDragonBox Algebra 12+ is suitable for more advanced students than DragonBox 5+, as it covers curriculum from late primary to early high school. \r\n\r\nDragonBox uses a novel pedagogical method based on discovery and experimentation. Players learn how to solve equations in a playful and colorful game environment where they are encouraged to experiment and be creative. By manipulating cards and trying to isolate the DragonBox on one side of the game board, the player gradually learns the operations required to isolate X on one side of an equation. Little by little, the cards are replaced with numbers and variables, revealing the operators the player has been learning throughout the game. \r\n\r\nPlaying does not require supervision, although parents can assist them in transferring learned skills into pen and paper equation solving. It is a great game for parents to play with their kids and can even give them an opportunity to freshen up their own math skills.\r\n\r\nDragonBox was developed by former math teacher Jean-Baptiste Huyhn and has been heralded as a perfect example of game-based learning. As a result, it is currently forming the basis of an extensive research project by the Center For Game Science at the University of Washington.\r\n\r\nDragonBox Algebra has received many distinctions including the Gold Medal of the 2012 Serious Play Award (USA), the Best Serious game at Bilbao´s Fun and Serious Game Festival and the Best Serious Game at the 2013 International Mobile Gaming Awards. It is also recommended by Common Sense Media where it won the Learn ON award.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n* 10 progressive chapters\r\n* 10 practice chapters\r\n* 357 puzzles \r\n* Basic algebraic rules with which the child can experiment\r\n* A focus on minimal instruction encourages creativity and experimentation from the player \r\n* Multiple profiles for easy progress control \r\n* Dedicated graphics and music for each chapter \r\n* Multiple supported languages: English, français, norsk, svenska, dansk, español, 한국어, italiano, português, Deutsch, русский, 简体中文, 繁體中文, suomi, Nederlands, Eesti, Euskara, Türkçe, Čeština, Lietuvių, Magyar, 日本語...\r\n\r\nAwards:\r\n\r\nGold Medal\r\n2013 International Serious Play Awards","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDGLD3","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"My Video Journal","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9788.9007199266310788.1b80387a-a370-4389-81c5-dc486915916e.9b1cb38b-5524-4ce3-8f80-b23bcb7fa046","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42079.9007199266310788.3735e009-4fee-4466-8a50-272f38419e12.4dce823a-6a3f-4e67-8784-b30e986f96fc","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"$2.49⁺","Price":2.49,"AverageRating":3.7,"RatingsCount":"27","PackageFamilyNames":["HouseofFileAppDevelopment.MyVideoJournal_9fahdympy29tg"],"ContentIds":["f4c43b61-1a5c-6034-2db4-d494a6fb7ec0"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Capture and re-live your life in video!  \r\n\r\n\"My Video Journal\" gives users the power to create multimedia diaries or business journals using their Windows 8 device with ease.

If the child selects the wrong shape, then they will be prompted with the correct number. Therefore, the picture will always be colored correctly, and the child will quickly memorize the numbers. Children can choose to color by geometrical figures and pictograms in addition to numbers. A child can easily distinguish a square from a circle, diamond, and triangle.\r\nSchool-age children will enjoy the complex coloring mode. Here the picture is divided into a large number of elements, thus making it difficult at first to determine what it depicts. Older children can complicate the task by adding addition and subtraction tasks. Now children will need to solve the examples and choose the correct answers in order to color the picture. This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.\r\nThose who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter. Coloring by letters will be useful for children preparing to enter primary school.\r\nTo make the coloring process more interesting and fun, you can change any of the preset colors. To do this, press and hold the jar of paint and a palette will open. Then you can choose your favorite color. Thus, all the shaded areas of the image can be changed in the coloring by number mode.

We've also released a brand new PC version of Chaos Control optimised for better desktop experience. You can find more info and download the new app on our website: http://chaos-control.mobi\r\n*******\r\n\r\nPeople don't usually achieve impressive results simply by being good at task management. It's the ability to set legitimate goals that makes the difference. Just write down your desired outcomes to make them real. This simple technique helps you to prioritize your goals before acting on them.\r\n\r\nChaos Control is a task manager based on the best ideas of GTD (Getting Things Done) methodology created by David Allen. Whether you are running a business, launching an app, working on a project or simply planning your holiday trip, Chaos Control is a perfect tool to manage your goals, juggle your priorities, and organize your tasks to get things done. And the best part is, you can handle both heavyweight project planning and simple daily routine like shopping list management in one flexible app. Also, Chaos Control is available across all major mobile and desktop platforms with seamless sync.\r\n\r\nHERE IS HOW IT WORKS:\r\n\r\n1) MANAGE YOUR PROJECTS\r\nProject is a goal combined with a set of tasks you need to complete in order to achieve it. Create as many projects as you like to write down all the desired outcomes you have\r\n\r\n2) ORGANIZE YOUR GOALS\r\nCreate unlimited number of projects and group them by category using Folders\r\n\r\n3) USE GTD CONTEXTS\r\nOrganize tasks from different projects using flexible context lists. If you are familiar with GTD you would just love this feature\r\n\r\n4) PLAN YOUR DAY\r\nSet due dates for tasks and make plans for any particular day\r\n\r\n5) USE CHAOS BOX\r\nPut all the incoming tasks, notes and ideas into Chaos Box in order to process them later. It works similar to GTD inbox, but you can use it as a simple to-do list\r\n\r\n6) SYNC YOUR DATA\r\nChaos Control works on both desktop and mobile devices. Setup an account and sync your projects across all of your devices\r\n\r\nThis app is designed with creative people in mind. Designers, writers, developers, startup founders, entrepreneurs of all kinds and pretty much anyone with ideas and desire to make them happen. We combined the power of GTD with the convenient interface to help you with:\r\n■ personal goal setting\r\n■ task management\r\n■ time management\r\n■ planning your business and personal activities\r\n■ building your routine\r\n■ handling simple to do lists, checklists and shopping lists\r\n■ catching your ideas and thoughts to process them later\r\n\r\nKEY FEATURES\r\n■ Seamless cloud sync across all major mobile and desktop platforms\r\n■ GTD-inspired Projects and Contexts supplemented with Folders, sub-folders and sub-contexts\r\n■ Recurring tasks (daily, weekly, monthly and chosen days of the week)\r\n■ Chaos Box - Inbox for your unstructured tasks, notes, memos, ideas and thoughts. Great tool for staying on track inspired by GTD ideas\r\n■ Notes for tasks, projects, folders and contexts\r\n■ Fast and smart search\r\n\r\nHave a productive
