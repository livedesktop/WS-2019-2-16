To capture the King you must place it in check.  If the King cannot escape by itself, or with the help of its army, it is in checkmate and the King is captured.\r\n \r\nZingMagic’s multi award winning Chess application supports over 20 levels of play allowing you to play moves or games against the clock or relax and play at your own pace.

This freedom of choice provides a compelling narrative that served as the cornerstone of the title's success on its initial release.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9MXSQFN9VD3X","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Typing Game Collection","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14431.13888397603078721.f53f6379-f4c6-45f7-87ed-799f15ab8190.2a5c30f7-6faa-4402-84c1-1142ebe77329","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51665.13888397603078721.f53f6379-f4c6-45f7-87ed-799f15ab8190.93906737-b069-4b5e-a601-e5eea3b73577","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31160.13888397603078721.f53f6379-f4c6-45f7-87ed-799f15ab8190.dc6bbdf6-faf3-4693-af0c-471f098329d5","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45629.13888397603078721.f53f6379-f4c6-45f7-87ed-799f15ab8190.6ae72bb9-c277-47c8-8809-a29f31261985","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3167.13888397603078721.f53f6379-f4c6-45f7-87ed-799f15ab8190.3df5ed4b-f4e6-417a-9f1e-569de0aa060a","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.43649.13888397603078721.f53f6379-f4c6-45f7-87ed-799f15ab8190.a559ebb2-eb09-44f4-b937-ec9d45d60a7c","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51948.13888397603078721.f53f6379-f4c6-45f7-87ed-799f15ab8190.21d96f01-42c3-4aeb-8106-f7b89bef8f01","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28509.13888397603078721.f53f6379-f4c6-45f7-87ed-799f15ab8190.2ef08d3b-553a-43f1-9c5e-3dcebc48c057","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63339.13888397603078721.f53f6379-f4c6-45f7-87ed-799f15ab8190.4acc5c99-f3a1-465e-a951-9077b833e3d1","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$1.99","Price":1.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["13849dogNet.TypingGameCollection_2bsj7y290vkqp"],"ContentIds":["532f3530-82d5-4423-decb-75b06bc1fbd1","018c30f4-5efa-e3a9-64ec-df352ababeb7"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"This typing game collection makes you learn touch typing with fun.\r\nIt now contains two games:\r\nBomb Dropper——Bombs with letters on it drop from the top one by one and all you need to do is pressing the relative key to remove it.

The game is played with a standard deck of cards (including 2 jokers). \r\n\r\nPlayers are dealt a total of 12 cards.  The remaining 6 cards are dealt face down into the 'Kitty'.  Each player will bid starting clockwise from the dealer (dealer bids last).  \r\nThe bid consists of a bid number and description.  The bid number is the number of tricks (books) a player believes his partnership can achieve over 6. For example, a bid of 4 = 10 books. \r\n\r\nThe bid description indicates a bid direction (High or Low) or whether the bid is a 'No' trump. A bid direction of High (Uptown) indicates A,K,Q... are the highest value cards. A bid direction of Low (Downtown, Special) indicates A,2,3... are the highest value cards. A 'No' trump bid indicates that each suit has equal weight and the lead card can not be 'cut'.  The bid direction of a 'No' bid is specified after winning the bid.\r\nBid numbers can range from 3 - 7.  The Option screen gives the player the option of playing with a minimum of 3 or 4.\r\nBid descriptions have the following weights:  'No' > 'Low' > 'High'.  The Option screen allows the player to play make 'Low' and 'High' equal in weight: 'No' > 'Low' = 'High'. \r\n\r\nThe highest bidder indicates a 'trump' suit or in the case of a 'No' bid indicates the direction (High/Low).  The jokers become the highest value cards in the indicated 'trump' suit.  For example, if Diamonds were called as 'trump' the highest value cards for a 'High' direction would be:  Big Joker, Little Joker, A, K,...  In the case of a 'No' bid, the Big Joker and Little Joker have no value and should be discarded as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThe bid winner will start play as the lead player.  The remaining players must play a card in the same suit as the lead card if available. If the player does not have a card in that suit they may play another suit. The highest value card in the lead suit wins the sequence unless a trump card is played in which case the highest trump card wins the sequence. The winner of the sequence will be the lead player in the following sequence. \r\n\r\nGame Options\r\n\r\nPractice Mode:  The computer will not bid.  Allowing the player to always win bid and practice different plays.\r\nScoring - Conventional and Progressive:  With Conventional scoring the bid winner may go into negatives if the bid is not acheived.  Progressive scoring will award points to the opposition team if the bid is not achieved.\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4RB61","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"AVI Video Converter","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28795.13510798887416290.64066cd8-0174-4ef4-8cd0-847844f3f344.41f48b8c-6c68-4d31-8716-1457d6dff86d","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61159.13510798887416290.de7531d2-848b-406c-981e-194c4f4283be.ae89c426-0615-440f-87a6-5b5008d96800","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$1.99","Price":1.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["32379.AVIVideoConverter_e8nt9294xhs6y"],"ContentIds":["567db4e2-7673-9516-0ddb-6e0829d766e0","d79390e2-1e23-6853-1358-956969fe50d8","654c84ba-ebec-334b-a046-6ab1deaa219e"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"AVI Video Converter enables you convert  WMV, MP4, VOB, MKV, MP4, 3GP, RMVB, FLV, and QuickTime MOV video to AVI video.

The app also comes with several tone mapping algorithms that converts HDR image back to SDR image. \r\n\r\nIf you are wondering how the magic happens behind the screen, here is a good explanation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkQJdaGGVM8\r\n\r\nYou can use this app to develop raw files. The HDR processing pipeline can be used to recover significant details from the image's highlight and shadow. \r\n\r\nThe app also allows you to acquire images directly from the Windows device's back facing camera (limited HW compatibility)\r\n\r\nSupported image merge method :\r\n  - Exposure fusion (generates SDR image directly without tonemapping)\r\n  - Exposure weighted merge (genearte true HDR image, require tonemapping to compress the dynamic range for viewing and printing)\r\n\r\nInput format supported:  JPG (8bpc),  TIF (8bpc), TIF (16bpc)\r\nInput raw file format supported: 3FR, ARW, CR2, CRW, DNG, NEF, ORF, RAF, RW2.\r\n\r\nOutput format:  JPG (8bpc), TIF (8bpc), TIFF(16bpc), Radiance HDR(32bpc)\r\n\r\nInput images should alter only in exposure time, not aperture nor ISO settings. They do not have to be in equal EV steps, The images should have the exposure time in its EXIF tag in order to use the exposure weighted merger.\r\n\r\nTo capture a series of images for HDR:\r\n - Set your camera to JPG(FINE) or TIFF image quality\r\n - Set your camera to bracket mode, with compensation to either 1.0EV or 2 EV per step, and 3 or 5 frames. You could go for more frames if the scene require higher dynamic range.\r\n - Set the camera's burst mode to high if available, this shortens the time need to acquire the images and reduce image alignment requirement later on\r\n - Set the camera on a tripod or a stable place, \r\n - Release the shutter to capture all images.\r\n\r\nLoad all images (JPG/TIFF) into the app and select the desired merge method and tonemapping method. Once satisfied the preview result, tap generate HDR to generate the full-res picture. Adjust the light/contrast/toning and hit save.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this app require a lot of system memory when merging images. For device that come with less than 3GB memory, please use no more than 3x12MP images.\r\n\r\nThis app uses 'libraw' library for RAW processing. For more details please see: https://www.libraw.org/ . The complete list of supported camera can be found:

large videos into smaller high quality videos of equal time interval.\r\n\r\nA video could be split based on specified Time in Seconds or Minutes.\r\n\r\nFor example : \r\na) If there is a video of duration 50 seconds, just specify the time in Seconds in which you want it to split. If you specify 10 seconds, the application will split the video into 5 parts each having 10 seconds duration.If you specify the time to 5 seconds, the application will split the video into 10 videos , each having duration of 5 seconds.\r\n\r\nThe generated videos are numbered so that their playing order could be understood. For example : A video named \"Video.MP4\" will be split into Video_1.MP4, Video_2.MP4, Video_3.MP4 and so on.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple benefits of splitting the video.\r\nFor example : \r\n\r\n-- If there is a video of 100MB, you could split them into chunks of smaller sizes and send them in multiple emails.\r\n-- You could split video based on time and have multiple video parts that are equal in time duration. This could be very useful if you have to offer episodes or tutorials of a specified time duration.\r\n-- There are various messaging platforms that impose size restrictions on videos. In such cases, the entire large video could be sent by splitting it into multiple small videos using the application.\r\n-- You could divide the large video into videos of smaller duration and upload them to your website. Later on you could provide the links of each part separately to download.\r\n-- Apart from this, wherever there are size limitations for the video, the application could prove to be very beneficial by splitting the videos into smaller sized videos.","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRCSCD8","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Frisky!
