Writer is a free text and code editor app with over 20 supported file types, and active syntax highlighting that updates as you edit documents.  Use it as a replacement for Notepad and other quick edit apps.\r\n\r\nThe app has been built from the ground up for Windows 10.  It's fast and fluid, and gives you the power to edit documents with features you'd normally only find in desktop apps.  Code Writer is perfect for editing any text-based file, doing code reviews, or giving presentations with code samples.\r\n\r\nThe text editor allows you to edit documents in near full-screen mode with the chrome fading to the background.  The collapsible side bar houses features like a document explorer, search functionality, advanced editing commands, print/share, settings, and help.  A popup command palette provides quick keyboard access to almost every command in the app.\r\n\r\nEasily create new or open existing documents from any accessible source.  Color is used pervasively throughout the app to create a bond between you and the various file types you work with.\r\n\r\nConfigure the editor theme and other options such as font size to mold your ideal editing environment.  Learn about every product feature with the included detailed documentation.\r\n\r\nThe app requires Windows Fall Creators Update or later, and is fully supported on ARM, x86, and x64 devices.\r\n\r\nIF YOU LIKE THIS FREE APP, PLEASE SUPPORT ITS CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT WITH GOOD RATINGS.  We have many plans for further improvements but want to hear your suggestions too.  It is most helpful if you post your own ideas for app features in our support forum or in the Windows Feedback app (instead of or in addition to reviews in the Store) so that we can communicate directly with you.  Sometimes we may need more information about the feature request and by posting in our forums or the Feedback app, we can get that from you.  Thank you for your support, it is much appreciated.  Happy coding!\r\n\r\nFollow us on Twitter with @CodeWriterApp.\r\n\r\nYou can even chat directly with our dev team via Slack (http://www.actiprosoftware.com/community/chat) to help guide future Code Writer features!","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFHZVP","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"XE Currency","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42975.9007199266248874.1c4642ea-361f-4b28-812f-86c638c1c0b9.2ce76d0f-6dab-45a8-ba78-e80f4ba3381c","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#11165E","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8717.9007199266248874.059c5c66-6048-4417-9e28-c08b2cb2a2a9.6b415150-4e66-4dfc-a379-1851172af2e4","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#11165E","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.0,"RatingsCount":"3","PackageFamilyNames":["XE.com.XECurrency_03yfs222qanwj"],"ContentIds":["6ce35c27-3658-e68a-5c16-773a9408af89"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Whether you’re working on your desktop computer or traveling with your tablet, you can easily convert every world currency with the XE Currency App for Windows 8.

Using any Windows Mixed Reality headset, including VR or HoloLens, you and your teammates can virtually inhabit a design, helping to facilitate clear and efficient communication about complex spatial issues.\r\n\r\nWith SketchUp Viewer, you also have the ability to interact with your designs as virtual or holographic scale models, supplementing or alleviating the need to build physical models of your projects.\r\n\r\nThe application includes many of the viewing, navigation and information tools that SketchUp users will be familiar with. You can easily fly around your project models by choosing from the list of the scenes that you’ve created in SketchUp; toggle layer visibility on-and-off to control model visibility; and use the Tape Measure tool and Entity Info tool to quickly access important information about your model.\r\n\r\nSketchUp Viewer is free to install and requires that users sign in with a Trimble Account.

These objects may be filled with solid colors, patterns, radial or linear color gradients and their borders may be stroked, both with adjustable transparency. Embedding and optional tracing of raster graphics is also supported, enabling the editor to create vector graphics from photos and other raster sources. Created shapes can be further manipulated with transformations, such as moving, rotating, scaling and skewing.\r\n\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inkscape\r\n\r\nYou can support Inkscape! https://inkscape.org/en/support-us/donate/","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PDSCC711RVF","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"English (United States) Local Experience Pack","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36092.14148384735843002.22483fbb-311f-452a-ae29-22780d36d46a.ad41bc82-178a-47cd-aba3-951647d4333b","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["Microsoft.LanguageExperiencePacken-US_8wekyb3d8bbwe"],"ContentIds":["4eacb444-9f26-8730-5e76-71cb23c8b7dd","115703bf-b0b7-d7e3-9b33-a338038c12f3"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Always up-to-date, always improving Windows language experience!\n\n    Windows is now delivering free language updates through the Microsoft Store.

We wanted to do the same thing. Unfortunately, we found that using an MP3 player or iPhone for this purpose was very awkward. We would often start the wrong song or have a hard time seeing the song titles. It was also a chore to \"train\" teammates to be the \"D.J.\" \r\n\r\nThe solution:\r\nThis app solves this problem. Each of the buttons is large and easy to see. You can pick the correct song each time, no matter how big your fingers are. Since the songs are named and organized in the filesystem, not the app, there is no data entry or creating of playlists required. The fades are very professional.\r\n\r\nWINDOWS STORE EXCLUSIVE","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

The 3D model viewer application has been created to allow easy access to new models developed by the ENGINO team and gradually the users themselves. All ENGINO sets have printed step by step instructions for the main models but many additional models can be created. With the new generation of technology where smart phones and tablets have become a part of every-day life, it is essential to enable the users to see new model ideas on these devices. The model viewer has an extensive library of models, continually updated, from cars to motorbikes, planes, helicopters, trucks, cranes and many more! The user can select which model to view and once this is loaded to the application, then the user can rotate the model to see it from various angles, he can zoom in to observe connecting details and most importantly he can explode the model and see how each part connects to the other one.","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9MXDW43WS6X5","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Chiappa Firearms Gun Simulator","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57423.13896168404252434.4ac1b8fe-b25d-4880-b075-628a56cbd70b.e78e1ab9-fce6-4749-b264-ec1a5558c449","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42011.13896168404252434.38f37bdb-666f-4f4d-b324-2bb4fdfc2eac.68390c5a-d6e2-490d-a5cd-cfdce7d5bd9f","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["22527ina.petrova.85.ChiappaFirearmsGunSimulator_7d2m0mhkspagw"],"ContentIds":["32e4ffad-4a22-06f2-d5a2-94918cbf7d95","6ba71322-34a0-8921-2c16-54f09cd88909"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Chiappa Firearms Gun Simulator is a new weapon simulator for Windows devices and you can have it for free if you decide to download our gun app. We have made this gun simulator for all of those weapon lovers out there and especially for the admirers of Chiappa Firearms Company.
