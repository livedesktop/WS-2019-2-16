Sight words account for a large percentage of the words used in literature for children. One advantage for children being able to recognize sight words automatically is that the child will be able to identify the majority of words in a book before they even attempt to read it. When the child is able to do that they'll be able to concentrate on the meaning and comprehension as they read without having to stop to figure out the actual word.)","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFHWFK","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Skulls of the Shogun","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.5136.9007199266246748.e6cb85f0-8e67-402f-8019-90e10faedb40.1d23d216-dd78-416d-85d1-a0ca6b022caf","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#222222","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.60007.9007199266246748.ae96f67f-62ad-4f17-9ccd-03c9c388f72a.a4eb0af0-d224-414e-b966-089a97388d38","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#222222","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£4.19","Price":4.19,"AverageRating":4.2,"RatingsCount":"78","PackageFamilyNames":["Microsoft.SkullsOfTheShogun_8wekyb3d8bbwe"],"ContentIds":["6e05513c-cc4e-4b27-d910-a3dc1fc1eefc","60a90895-ee7b-f8d2-d6f2-886bf2c137db"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Washing up on the shores of the afterlife, players meet and join forces with vibrant ghost-samurai warriors, magical animal-monks, and mustachioed samurai generals on the way to capture Skulls of the Shogun.

That’s why we have developed Multiplication Dragons, to provide new, fun ways to engage with multiplication that stimulate ease of memorization and improved recall. We all know how difficult it is to remember things without using the proper tools, and Multiplication Dragons provides just that. Our brightly colored, unique, three-dimensional environments provide visual and auditory spaces in which children can learn by associating multiplication questions with a rhyme, an in-game location, and the dragon that asks the question.\r\n\r\nMultiplication Dragons helps increase memorization and ease of recall using two memory devices that reinforce each other: rhyme and the memory palace (a.k.a. the method of loci). It will introduce your child to the world of multiplication using 3D animated dragons that guide them through 12 different environments, including a lagoon, a Halloween inspired level, a mountain, caves, a winter setting, and more! Each of the 144 questions is asked by one of our many dragons, stationed in various locations and levels throughout the game. Questions are asked using a phrase that both rhymes with the answer, and relates to the particular surroundings of the level currently being played. Multiplication questions also appear onscreen and are read aloud, a design feature used to help young readers and those experiencing difficulty reading, and to provide our dragons with a bit of extra personality. \r\n\r\nWe draw on rhyme because it has been used in various ways and has stood the test of time as a mnemonic device. After all, how many times has the age-old “thirty days has September, April, June, and November” rhyme helped you to recall the number of days in a month? It has been used for generations, and proven its success over and over again. Our second memory device, the memory palace, is one of the oldest and most successful tools in the book! This method goes back to the ancient Greeks, and involves imagining a familiar environment (like your home) and associating the things to be remembered with particular areas or aspects of that environment.  The visual and spatial qualities of this form provide additional contact points that aid in the creation of cognitive associations with the thing that we want to remember. This creates more access routes for our brains to get at the desired information, and thus increases ease of recall. By using both of these methods together we have increased these possible cognitive associations even further, while providing you and your child with hours of fun!\r\n\r\nChildren will earn 1-3 stars based on the amount of correct answers given on a level, giving them the opportunity to return to a level and break their current score. They will also get an encouraging cheer from our dragons for each right or wrong answer, and unlock new levels by successfully completing a timetable level. They can also make use of an added visual cue by reviewing the timetable itself, and test recall by attempting quiz mode. Here, your child must answer questions without the rhymes, and in random order, simulating a school math test. And unlike other games that offer one free level and then charge you for the remaining eleven, we ask for one payment which includes access to all twelve levels, quiz mode, and timetable mode.\r\n\r\nMultiplication Dragons provides your child with a whole world of exploration that introduces, reinforces, and tests multiplication skills, in a mode that feels like play. It’s time exchange the mechanical repetition of rote learning for techniques that make memorization easy and fun. Add some good-times to your tables, with Multiplication Dragons!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH0MB2C","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Hero Panda Bomber","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35995.13510798883149968.be4d6453-9236-4895-8e00-9a79e24256c4.979b5317-8183-47b2-b17f-2796be5374eb","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35907.13510798883149968.80d072b3-3533-4001-9d52-38f3130b6ff4.2cfd851a-cdb2-4ff0-b760-eed5222cb13f","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57018.13510798883149968.232a22cf-b206-4cd4-9df6-c28776f0ccdf.1d8b1856-fdfd-4900-920d-d30efae300a3","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.903.13510798883149968.624f2222-0182-4c52-a5e0-d768e911af0e.2f07f7cc-fe85-4efd-8149-404cd060dc01","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"StrikethroughPrice":"£2.79","DisplayPrice":"£1.29","Price":1.29,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["836FFCD0.HeroPandaBomber_2azc2x09rfb7a"],"ContentIds":["cea6362f-1ebd-4194-9887-540c3cc8ad39"],"Badges":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V3.ProductBadge, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","StyleKey":"Default","Text":"Caomhain £1.50","Type":"Merchandized"}],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Want to play a game and also help real-life Pandas?\r\n\r\nMeet Hero Panda Bomber, a great game with a classic Bomberman-style gameplay already loved by 50,000 users.

Wield magic cards instead of weapons and slay the armies of darkness in the dungeons below the Old Cathedral. Save the terror-stricken Paperverse from the clutches of the Archdemon himself! \r\n\r\nCARDS AND DECKBUILDING\r\nIt’s not a card game, but items, spells, and skills are all expressed as cards. The strategy lies in adapting your hand to each situation. Cards can be upgraded with runes and you can find many variants with diverse bonuses. Legendaries are the most epic but hard to acquire.\r\n\r\nTAILORED SESSIONS WITH FLEXISCOPE\r\nBook of Demons respects your time. It features the Flexiscope engine which allows you to divide the game into sessions of any size. It even learns your pace of gaming and predicts the time to complete the next session.\r\n\r\nUNIQUE MECHANICS\r\nSimplified movement and fight mechanics is where Book of Demons differs the most from other hack & slash games. There is often not enough time to click-remove all of the obstacles such as monster shields, enemy spells, poison, or knocked cards, so timing, card selection and order of execution are critical.\r\n\r\nHACK & SLASH IN THE WORLD OF PAPERVERSE\r\nBook of Demons takes place in Paperverse, a world that exists entirely inside a pop-up book. It’s a tale of good and evil about saving the world from the ultimate devilry. Sounds familiar? Inspired by the dark and gloomy atmosphere of the first Diablo game, Book of Demons is part tribute part parody of hack & slash classics.\r\n\r\nCOMFORT OF GAMEPLAY\r\nMany Book of Demons features were designed with gameplay comfort in mind. Points of interest are marked at the top of the screen and get revealed once you get closer. Your character leaves footprints, which can be used to track your way back or notice paths already visited without opening the map.\r\n\r\nCHALLENGING ENDGAME\r\nOn average it takes about 10 hours to complete the campaign with a single class, but maxing out a character and mastering all of the higher Freeplay difficulty levels and Quests takes much longer. The Roguelike mode offers another level of challenge with permadeath, restricted healing and even more obstacles to overcome.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4RJ04","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Planet Genesis","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49697.13510798887415179.3de04683-b32d-4c5e-89d0-8b644f28c46f.19321d49-db3e-4c45-9c2d-e1dd96e5d3a7","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5176.13510798887415179.da7db781-9e9d-49ce-8462-6e84a6566e3a.db84766f-346f-487b-a5b0-fd4b43be3652","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26899.13510798887415179.82a50537-f216-46aa-a51c-7e28bf121254.5f8b00d2-e1c8-429b-9c2e-4df04ff18c11","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7262.13510798887415179.295a0534-0d5b-440b-99ec-d901b7de5c24.7a4b052e-b76e-4867-a79e-6309e5ff1d92","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56888.13510798887415179.6eb68e11-e64c-4565-96fe-9d3fdfee52e2.9676cfba-8024-40d1-a491-bce7b0b226bd","Height":434,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62291.13510798887415179.009872b2-04d3-46b6-b68e-a5631de056b6.c01ac081-ffe1-4c6f-9917-22f2e2a509a7","Height":558,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50821.13510798887415179.bb564dc1-9d0e-4c8a-8c6d-512f43dd0927.49d2f367-ef2f-4290-9a95-228e7f0edcaa","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.21950.13510798887415179.23695abc-d0c7-472a-b12c-9f0b2552cc8f.5cfabaff-a45a-43f0-9c94-fd0c6f768096","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24200.13510798887415179.db060858-f3ea-4fb0-a97c-18ddc6a371c0.1cd00a95-a42a-48d1-8bf9-726ea1e62c7d","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63589.13510798887415179.152512b8-fd69-4825-a99a-0efd08c784f5.e3a7d5a7-4c6e-40bd-989e-44a03e164eec","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£0.79","Price":0.79,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["63289RaptorClawEntertainm.PlanetGenesis_m35xss3rs3j1w"],"ContentIds":["14ff1925-b3e0-7b6d-cd59-79a0f7e8466f"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Planet Genesis is one of the finest and most visually stunning universe sandboxes available for Windows devices.

They understood, much better than any other people at that time - the art of economics. From their trading centers in the Baltic Sea, Birka and Haithabu they sailed the seas and developed extensive trade routes from Russia to the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nThe game considers all aspects of Vikingism in a fantastic and realistic 3D world - trade, economics, and combat to a degree that may have been in the real life of a Viking.\r\n\r\nGoal is to build a robust economic system with a flourishing maritime trade under realistic climatic and seasonal conditions. Only with the income of your island production, the merchandising and the reward of fullfilled tasks - you’re able to fulfill the claims of your lord - Thorvaldson.\r\nBut apart from the harsh climate and other bad circumstances, the multitude of enemies are the biggest threat to your prosperity and your life. As a loyal swordsman of Thorvaldson, you will receive guard troops and can protect your village with massive weapons. Protection that you need to defend you properties and inhabitants.\r\n\r\nOther information about the game:\r\nThe presentation of the figures, the calendar and the seasons, are largely based on historical traditions and geographical conditions. At the presentation of battle scenes, however, in order to increase the thrill, we have used a little bit of fantasy.\r\nThe in-game time of the game is divided so that 1 hour of real time means a day in-game. This results in a varied and long lasting playing time in which you can do your daily work.\r\n\r\nIn order to learn ongoing more about the details of the game, we recommend that you follow us on IndieDB: https://www.indiedb.com/games/vikingjourney\r\n\r\nHere you will ongoing articles about the Gameplay and new Features.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NJC2PVXG8WB","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"ACA NEOGEO FATAL FURY","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24470.13679025669124291.4f43ea9b-b4cf-4d91-b81b-e618e9ff39c5.a9b0173c-d0be-4984-8a56-9ac50dbb6abb","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42413.13679025669124291.28acb874-2a06-461f-9314-678176935df7.d18ab57b-7625-4e52-ba79-e665621309a0","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55121.13679025669124291.f84b3cc9-5e51-4d66-abaf-0e513e0021d8.5233690e-4a94-48be-a95d-a21fba5f931c","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29678.13679025669124291.4848c214-91fb-4de2-86a1-73468db0d929.9fecec9e-8375-4e9a-80a5-2ab0cd1a9c0d","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22778.13679025669124291.73360e66-cde2-48b0-ae17-30d1e3a96a42.32d47fc9-f5c1-401c-ae61-3702e63fe76e","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£6.09","Price":6.09,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["HAMSTERCorporation.ACANEOGEOFATALFURY_7xd3265gdqs6r"],"ContentIds":["4ab9efda-1622-d6fe-b900-858a15f7c343"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"\"FATAL FURY\" is a fighting game released by SNK in 1991.\r\nPlayers take part in brutal street fights in a variety of locations, with the goal of toppling the infamous crime lord Geese Howard.\r\nThe game includes very unique features when compared to other fighting games available at the time, including a special Line Battle system that allows players to traverse between the foreground and background and 2-player co-op functionality.\r\n\r\nThe \"ACA NEOGEO\" series has faithfully reproduced many classic NEOGEO masterpieces.\r\nPlayers can change various game settings such as game difficulty, and also reproduce the atmosphere of arcade display settings at that time.

Tycoon is an indie business strategy game about Computer Evolution and starting your own company in the 70s. Lead the research race until 2034, create the best hardware and operating system, take care of your infrastructure and even handle your marketing. Find video game gems to promote them on your platforms, conquer the global market and became literally immortal!\r\n\r\nComputer Tycoon is different from other building/tycoon games because it has a \"grand strategy game\" aspect. You will control your \"computer empire\" viewing a world map and managing resources.\r\n\r\nStart your adventure in the 70s as a small business somewhere in the world. Learn more about hardware and software inventions that were the first steps to our current modern world, and get a taste of what is waiting for us in the future. Find the classic video games and help a new culture to be born.\r\n\r\nIn Computer Tycoon the decisions you make during development really matter. Take advantage of the technology, upgrade and design combinations! Does your product need more computing capacity or should you focus more on features, low price or prestige? Maybe change to portable computers or develop more easy-to-use Operating Systems? These decisions will have a major impact on the success of your company.\r\n\r\nExpand your corporation in a smart way into multiple countries, build more offices, factories, laboratories and other required facilities. Poor countries have cheaper labor, but richer countries will give you more educated engineers.\r\n\r\nHaving the best product isn't enough. You must take care of people's needs or even \"change their needs\" using different marketing tools. Balance your budget well between development, production, marketing, and expansion.\r\n\r\nWe'll all die one day... but not in Computer Tycoon! You can win the game by becoming a monopoly or reaching the technological singularity if you are fast and healthy enough. Healthy? Yes, you have a small chance to die in the game, so you should regularly check your health.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

First we get acquainted with domestic animals, like for example, fluffy kittens and playful dogs. On the street, we come across small insects and chirping, spotted birds. In the zoo we can view wild animals, such as rabbits, a fox, and a bear. Every time we learn more and more about these co-habitants of our Earth! Some of them creep along, while others run on their paws; still others soar through the air! Some prefer to live in burrows, some in nests, while others just live in the trees or sleep in meadows. You'll see huge elephants and hippopotamuses, small chameleons and frogs, fast lions and slow turtles - herbivores and predators alike. We invite you to get acquainted with these marvelous representatives of the animal kingdom on the pages of our game!  \r\n\r\nConnect points is a learning puzzle for small children. It helps develop thinking, improve memory and attention. The application has three game modes: by numbers, letters and coloring. Game modes with letters and numbers will be useful for kindergarten and pre-K kids. \r\nConnecting by numbers will help to easily memorize the order of numbers and learn to count. To do this, you need to consecutively connect circles with numbers starting from 1. As you connect circles in the right order, the silhouette of a hidden picture will become more and more visible. If three points are chosen incorrectly, a tip will pop up. Once all the points are fully connected, the picture will become fully visible and you’ll be able to color it.\r\nThose studying the alphabet can choose to connect points by letters. It is important that children know letters as early as possible, since it is essential for learning to read and write. But knowing the order of letters in the alphabet is also very important! This can be achieved by connecting circles with letters in the right sequence.\r\nThe coloring mode will be especially appreciated by young artists. In this mode, you can proceed to coloring pictures without connecting points. To make the process even more exciting, you can change any predefined color. To do this, press and hold the paint bucket and choose the necessary color from the palette.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

Children can choose to color by geometrical figures and pictograms in addition to numbers. A child can easily distinguish a square from a circle, diamond, and triangle.\r\nSchool-age children will enjoy the complex coloring mode. Here the picture is divided into a large number of elements, thus making it difficult at first to determine what it depicts.

This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.\r\nThose who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter. Coloring by letters will be useful for children preparing to enter primary school.\r\nTo make the coloring process more interesting and fun, you can change any of the preset colors.

Her sister that lives in Europe called her to check out how Joan is doing. Since the two of them don't see each other rather often, Joan got an idea to invite her sister to com and spend a longer period of time in her home. The house is just fine but Joan considers that she needs to renovate the guest house before her sister comes. That way her sister will feel more comfortable to stay there longer.\r\n\r\nJoan will need our help because renovating the house includes a lot of responsibilities. There are a lot of objects that have to be taken away from the house before the actual renovation starts.

This isn't a shoot-em-up, just a laid-back, enjoyable way to learn how to play poker. Relax and have fun!\r\n\r\nAnnie, Cowboy, Gambler, and The Kid are four wisecracking card sharks who will try to take your money!\r\n\r\nEach player has his own unique style of play - and playing against those styles, combined with the Hints and context-based Strategy, should help you learn how to play poker. \r\n\r\nPlayers:\r\nAnnie: Annie is no stranger to these tables and she is much tougher than she looks. To her, poker is much more than a game, its how she makes her living. If you're not careful, she will take your money in a big hurry! She doesn't like to lose so she'll fold on a weak hand but bet hard on a strong one.\r\n\r\nCowboy: The Cowboy is a tough one to figure out. Maybe he's had a tough day and is distracted. Maybe he's just not very good at poker. Sometimes he'll fold on a good hand and bluff a bad one. However, if he has a really good hand, he'll usually bet.\r\n\r\nKid: The Kid is in town looking for a good time. He has money to burn and has been in the Casino a bit too long. His loose and passive play can be irritating. He'll make a mistake or two but be careful, he can fool you into losing your money!\r\n\r\nGambler: The Gambler is a bona fide \"shark\" and knows the odds. He is here for one reason only - to take your money! He plays tight and aggressive which means he'll usually bet on a hand he thinks can win. If he doesn't think he'll win a hand, he'll fold so be careful when he decides to bet. He'll bluff every now and then, just to keep you on your toes.\r\n\r\nLearn to Play:\r\nYou have many options for hints and strategy. Hints are displayed to help you decide whether to Bet, Raise, Call, or Fold. The Strategy Mode gives you more information about your hand and your odds of improving. You also have the option of seeing your opponents’ cards during the deal! \r\n\r\nIf you find a bug or enjoy the program, please let us know!

With an endless gameplay, Floaties will keep you hooked as you travel 8 different worlds filled with specific obstacles. All you have to do is tap to keep the characters floating, but the easy controls are balanced by an almost impossible gameplay. Dare to take this challenge?\r\n\r\nMain Features:\r\n✔ Endless Floating Gameplay. Control up to 4 “floaties” at the same time each with its own color by simply tapping to help them float. Each floatie is immune to the same color obstacles but is destroyed instantly by obstacles with other colors. Your main goal is to have a fleet of all colors and to try surviving the longest. Easy to play, but impossible to survive for long!\r\n\r\n✔ 8 Adventurous Worlds. Help your floaties survive through the ancient world of Egypt, the sci-fi landscape of the Moon, the unlawful Wild Wild West, the dangerous Jurassic Park and more. Each of the 8 playable worlds feature its own particularities depicted in eye-catching 3D graphics so get ready to dodge out-of-orbit satellites on the Moon, T-Rex bones in Jurassic Park and hundreds others!\r\n\r\n✔ Dozens of Characters. From flying drones, chicken, rockets to E.T., Cleopatra or even Jack the pirate you can unlock more than 40 different fun characters. Collect coins throughout the game and use those to spin the wheel of fortune to get a new random character or unlock your favorite one. Gain experience with each character and level them up to 5 stars!\r\n\r\n✔ Powerups and abilities. Aside coins you can collect special objects that help you gain powerups for a limited time (i.e. collect 4 potion bottles to double your coin collection for 15 seconds). With your new abilities you’ll survive longer and score higher. \r\n\r\n✔ Solve Quests. Each world has a theoretically endless flying/floating gameplay, although in reality you die A LOT, but offers side quests too. Can you collect 7 items of the same color? Or have one of RGBY floatie destroyed a couple of times? The more quests you solve, the tougher that level gets. You start at Easy, advance to Medium and become a master when you reach the Hard level of difficulty.\r\n\r\n✔ Achievements & Leaderboards. Connect via Google Play Services to unlock more achievements and access the social or global leaderboards if your score is high enough. You’ll also be able to analyze the statistics for each world, such as how many items you’ve collected, how many quests you’ve completed, what was the best score and MUCH MORE!\r\n\r\n✔ Multiplayer Challenges. Provoke up to 4 of your friends to a game of keeping floating characters alive! You can play the game in multiplayer mode and this gives 4 users the chance to play Floaties on the same device. Who can be the best? Only practice will tell!\r\n\r\nAside surviving all sorts of entrapments that destroy Floaties of a different color (i.e. than the obstacle color) you must collect coins, power-ups and character resurrection items. Play often and you will be able to get free coins too by pulling the handle of a slot machine. The same game will unlock a random character for 100 coins.\r\n\r\nEach world you play in features awesome 3D graphics and well designed characters that create a great gaming experience especially accompanied by an entertaining soundtrack and sounds.\r\n\r\nTHANK YOU for downloading, playing and rating Floaties!

It is a puzzle game developed in 1991 by DMA Design. The player takes command in the game of a bunch of small animals and has to guide them through levels. Since the animals walk on their own, the player can only influence them by giving them commands, like build a bridge, dig a hole or redirect all animals in the other direction. The goal of each level is to reach the exit, for this multiple combination of commands are necessary. The game is presented in a 2D site view. \r\n\r\nWhile Pingus is based on the idea of Lemmings, it however doesn't try to be an exact clone, it has included a few ideas of its own, like the worldmap or secret levels, which might be familiar from games the Super Mario World and other Nintendo games. It has also a few new actions, like the jumper which weren't presented in the original game.

It is based on the popular Austrian Tarock - also known as \"Königsrufen (King Calling)\".\r\n\r\nThe complete deck contains 54 cards, 32 color suit cards and 22 tarock cards. The color suits are: Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, and Spades. The tarock cards are labeled by roman numerals from I, II, III, ... to XXII and function in the game as a permanent suit of trumps. The playing order is counter-clockwise. The game starts with an auction process: The player with the highest bidding becomes the game declarer. There are positive games and negative games: In a positive game, the declarer must achieve a minimum number of points to win. In a negative game, the declarer must achieve the announced number of tricks (0 to 2) exactly. Basically, in all games, players have to follow suit. In negative games additionally, each player must overtrump if possible. Because there are special games for the forehand player, it never happens that all players pass and no game comes out. See Game Rules for the details.\r\n\r\nThe current version provides five playing modes:\r\n•Offline mode\r\n In this mode, the user controls at least one player. All other players will be controlled by the simulator \"Tarobot\". The simulator by the way sees only those cards the human player would also see. But you, too, can let the \"Tarobot\" support you in playing. If you select the appropriate setting, it marks the action on the user interface that it would perform in your place.\r\n•Learning mode\r\n In the learning mode you can question any action that the \"Tarobot\" simulator proposes for you. He will then tell you the reasons why he thinks the action makes sense. Of course, the Tarobot is not a person who takes into account the psychology of other players. He is a pure numeric, who expresses everything in numbers to evaluate them with his algorithms. But he knows all the rules and can give the beginner important hints when practicing the game.\r\n•Quiz mode\r\n This mode is a variant of the offline mode. In addition to the fun of playing, you can train your memory and thus your playing skills improve. Randomly selected questions about the current card playing state are presented to you during the game. After you have selected the supposedly correct answer, the solution will be presented to you immediately. Depending on the question you will get different number of points for the correct or also for an almost correct solution. In the quiz statistics you can read the development of your success in a calendar. If you have reached a minimum number of points and a minimum success rate, you will also receive symbolic awards such as flower pot, medal, and cup.\r\n•Online mode\r\n In this mode, up to 4 owners of a full license can play together online. If less then 4 users are participating in an online session, the remaining players are simulated. In parallel to the playing session, a Skype audio conference should be held, enabling the same conversation between the players as in a real card playing group. Before starting the first session, one of the online users must create a online user group. This user becomes the group administrator, responsible for maintaining the group. The lifespan of the group is limited to 90 days initially. By purchasing an add-on, the lifespan can be extended by 365 days per purchase. Online games are subject to charge. The full license already includes 25 payed online games. By purchasing an add-on, the contingent of payed online games can be increased by 100 or 500 games per purchase respectively.\r\n•Autonomous mode\r\n In this mode, the application plays completely independently without user participation. Of course, this is primarily intended for testing. But it can also be fun to watch.\r\n\r\nThe user interface shows a gaming table in the middle where the players can place their cards. On the four sides of the table, the four players are located showing the hand cards, the tricks pile and other details. Only the hand cards of the user-controlled players are shown face-up. All other hands are showing the cards facedown. You - the current Windows user, must control at least one player.\r\n\r\nIn an offline session, you can undo and redo all actions of the game. You may also utilize assistance from \"Tarobot\" while playing. For replaying games, you can allocate a game archive. The archived games can be reopened and automatically replayed to any situation of interest. Experts may even build their very own games based on an existing game by using the edit mode. In this mode, cards can be exchanged freely between the players and between players and the Talon.\r\n\r\nIn an online session, you can play Tarock with your friends wherever they may be. Most of the manipulation and assistance functions of the offline mode are disabled in this case. Even though, the group administrator can enable and disable some them, such as \"undo\", with mutual consent even during a session.\r\n\r\nMultiple settings options allow you to change game parameters and appearance. You may select another color theme or another card face or card back design for example. You even may insert your favorite photo in one of the card backs containing a special photo frame. You can also activate speech output. Then, for example, you will hear the announcements of the simulated players and you do not have to pay so much attention to the screen display.\r\n\r\nIn the comprehensive online-help, you can find a detailed description of the game rules and of the user interface. It also describes how to perform each of the playing tasks.\r\n\r\nKubiTarock is designed for the Universal Windows Platform. You can install and use the app on all devices powered by Windows 10. The user interface adapts itself to the current device capabilities.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDMC82","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"花札@GAMEPACK","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27354.9007199266440001.29873f52-40d1-4715-9d0d-38107572b3fe.d669cd51-6ffa-4666-b00b-96bc26257b6d","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41191.9007199266440001.7d842838-3913-41aa-9c97-09d8db9890b1.3572790d-18c5-4699-8e55-a0b1ba4eae58","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£2.49","Price":2.49,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["C00078DB.518278175E6F9_tyjbjaxc4qgce"],"ContentIds":["3625ac6f-28a6-15d5-02c3-88c39e8523cc"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"☆Sale Information☆\r\nHaving a sale now !\r\nTake advantage of our special offer !!\r\n-------------------------------\r\nHanafuda is a Japanese traditional card game! \r\n\"Koi-Koi\" is the most popular game of Hanafuda. \r\nDo you choose \"Koi-Koi\" or choose \"Sho-bu\"?\r\nLet's enjoy tactics!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDMZDJ","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Sparkle 2","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51272.9007199266455699.86b23e9d-1aa9-4b31-9e70-61eedb2fc99b.5248e7ae-a7ca-4922-b5b6-35c999da146c","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6316.9007199266455699.ab559daf-80af-48d6-95ab-45711ccfa8e1.f2aaeec9-7852-4d4f-95c9-e82580c3826e","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£4.99","Price":4.99,"AverageRating":4.2,"RatingsCount":"20","PackageFamilyNames":["43844A19.Sparkle2_j6tmt3vnwnhry"],"ContentIds":["2cbe9b0a-811a-f91a-1e3a-95e68074ee67"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"A long time ago, five keys were created.

She thinks that the tombs are actually forgotten and someone has to see what is hiding there.\r\n\r\nDuring her visit to the tombs in Luxor, Nicole realizes that he was right in her assumptions because very soon she starts discovering new things. Namely, she starts finding a lot of valuable objects including eight mummies undiscovered until now. This seems like a really important discovery but the findings don't stop here. Additionally Nicole discovers small statues that weren't found before in Egypt or on any other place around the world. She knows that her discovery is huge so she goes more into details and continues exploring every possible place really carefully.\r\n\r\nLet's look around together with Nicole and see what those tombs hide. This would definitely be an interesting adventure so we like to share it with you and give you one excellent experience.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N25HH4JN0LC","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Asdivine Hearts II","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22580.13962918820845600.cbafb7fa-d539-4834-a299-07cc8f85f3ad.106d533f-edec-459b-bc9a-a8ef84ca7ffa","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24435.13962918820845600.cbafb7fa-d539-4834-a299-07cc8f85f3ad.5270cc5e-9cc2-4b24-970c-44559ffcec47","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28393.13962918820845600.cbafb7fa-d539-4834-a299-07cc8f85f3ad.647907ea-d4db-442d-b467-43ce4a3ab2d6","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3923.13962918820845600.cbafb7fa-d539-4834-a299-07cc8f85f3ad.120a29e7-7f3d-4a4a-8a21-2e9f60ed29b9","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61422.13962918820845600.cbafb7fa-d539-4834-a299-07cc8f85f3ad.cf739152-b8f4-42bf-ab79-ec4db4297ad3","Height":2160,"Width":1440,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39636.13962918820845600.cbafb7fa-d539-4834-a299-07cc8f85f3ad.fde0db00-0016-49c0-95ac-6ea76b5eba2c","Height":2160,"Width":2160,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£12.49⁺","Price":12.49,"AverageRating":4.5,"RatingsCount":"11","PackageFamilyNames":["KEMCO.AsdivineHeartsII_f2bp5vqmgh7cp"],"ContentIds":["ddc0d7e4-4ce0-12e0-5b86-c87e0f527e7b","8407f142-2aa8-1989-57c0-c8b35cfdc2ab"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Xbox One","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"With a world on the verge of being frozen in ice, hearts unite once more in a sequel to the smash hit RPG series!\r\n\r\nPicking up two years after the events of their first adventure, Zack and friends find themselves off on another quest, but this time to save the parallel world of Archelio, which is on the verge of being frozen in ice.\r\n\r\nWith a convenient summary of the previous title included, players can jump right into Asdivine Hearts II without having played the first!\r\n\r\nUtilizing a brand new team system, lead up to six characters into battle, and destroy onslaughts of powerful foes!

Play with your friends from Facebook or with random rivals in the network!\r\n\r\nAre you a curling fan? Then try this Ultra-Realistic, 3D, Curling Simulation Game.\r\nYou’re not a curling fan? Try Curling3D anyway and you’ll fall in love with curling and our game.\r\n\r\nCurling3D is one of the best curling simulation games for one or two players. Similar to shuffleboard, the game is played on a flat ice curling sheet, roughly 15x150 feet. Players slide round stones of about 40 pounds towards bull's eye targets at either end. Two teammates may use brooms to sweep the ice in front of the moving stone. Curling3D is a follow-up to MaxNick's successful iCurling game, and adds a new dimension of realism with 3D rendering and on-screen players. Many user suggestions have been integrated into this new curling simulation.\r\n\r\nCurling3D attempts to simulate the excitement of the game by incorporating many aspects of the actual sport. Fundamentally, curling is about force, mass, friction, momentum, rotation and collision. The app exploits the sophisticated physics engine built into the iPhone OS to generate a convincing simulation of all these elements as they interact. In the terminology of curling, the weight is the velocity of the stone; the turn is the rotation of the stone (which affects its trajectory); and the line is the direction of the throw or delivery. Curling3D allows the player to continuously and independently control all three, permitting advanced tactics such as the guard, takeout, and tap. In addition, the app allows the player to sweep the ice while their stone is moving, adjusting trajectory after the delivery.\r\n\r\nTry it… you won’t be disappointed.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGGZHK1C","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Little Mole's Find It","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18134.13510798883287522.02f739bf-d71a-4f96-b3c2-7ab37fc3071f.403271bd-d0e0-45dc-83f5-4084a40e8594","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44970.13510798883287522.77961990-8f4f-48e3-b000-7801741159dc.a05c9a17-676a-4993-b930-9385cac39654","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£2.49","Price":2.49,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["SiliconJelly.LittleMolesFindIt_6v809z49xp5gp"],"ContentIds":["94f6a8bc-4aad-9ada-9c1b-95d614516510","be8ef4ec-211c-0bb1-4972-43fb9a879769"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"If you love the Little Mole, you need this game!
