As a part of the standard Windows installation those games have been popularized around the world. For each of those games millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms.

In particular, you don't have to drag individual cards - drag&drop whole column, only proper cards will move the rest will snap back. The scoring all the games is simplified to track only number of moves to solve the puzzle. If you stuck, feel free to use hints or undo - implemented by all the games.

zoals Foto in Foto (Pip), Casten naar Chromecast en DLNA, media inhoud opnemen, speelt rechtstreeks af van OneDrive & media servers en veel meer…\r\n\r\nMet Duplex Media Player + zal je genieten van alle media items en dit op je PC, Tablet, Mobile en ook op je grote schermen. \r\n\r\nPicture in Picture (Pip)\r\n--------------------------\r\nMet Pip heb je oneindig veel mogelijkheden, je kan op hetzelfde moment naar twee media streams kijken, of je kan naar een film kijken terwijl je een andere cast naar de TV van de kinderen, cast en neem veelvuldige media op op hetzelfde moment.\r\n\r\nCasten\r\n---------\r\nMet Duplex Media Player +, was casten nog nooit zo makkelijk. Je kan elke media casten naar elk DLNA of Chromecast apparaat. Het maakt niet uit of je apparaat de inhoud ondersteund of niet. Je kan zowel online streams als lokaal opgeslagen bestanden casten. Duplex Media Player + zal alle media casten naar elk apparaat, ook als het apparaat het formaat niet ondersteund (bijvoorbeeld, Chromecast ondersteund geen .FLV files, met Duplex Media Player + kan je nu .FLV en andere bestanden casten naar Chromecast apparaten)\r\n\r\nBovendien, indien je een trage netwerkverbinding hebt, of je media is gecodeerd met een hoge bitrate, niet geschikt voor casten, Duplex Media Player + kan een kopie generen die vlot afspelen en casten mogelijk maakt.\r\n\r\nOndertitels\r\n----------\r\nExtra bovenop het laden van lokale ondertitels, kan Duplex Media Player + automatisch ondertitels zoeken en downloaden voor u. Je kan de look van de ondertitels ook aanpassen. Bovendien laat tijd correctie toe om de timing van de ondertitels aan te passen.\r\n\r\nOpnemen\r\n------------\r\nMet één klik kan je opnames starten en stoppen. Je kan live en online streams opnemen op uw apparaat wanneer u maar wil. Zelf bij gebruik van Pip, kan je beide spelers afzonderlijk opnemen.\r\n\r\nAudio/Video Codecs\r\n------------------------\r\nDuplex Media Player + ondersteund alle gekende video/audio codecs. Je moet geen externe codecs installeren. Als je probeert dvd, .rm or .flv of elk ander formaat dat niet ondersteund is in Windows 10 af te spelen, dan is Duplex Media Player + wat je zoek.\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJBWS","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Virtual City 2: Paradise Resort HD","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.65344.9007199266251261.25fe8f43-656a-456f-a42d-5f15c59a83d4.b78dfc24-f277-477c-aaef-2aab10556431","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.49599.9007199266251261.43e1d614-0cbd-424a-8e79-d0c19e082a8c.e670af9f-0e9a-462e-9f78-2c19bdf69c1b","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.33019.9007199266251261.d927e5a7-a789-4afb-82d7-ac6fae0c17b1.f06cb643-bfaa-44e3-ae36-5c4877d18259","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.10795.9007199266251261.641625ce-ec8b-457f-82a1-cf16a47ad192.2db001d4-95fb-4067-8554-b00801931e05","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.14065.9007199266251261.fe8212b5-b9ca-4837-afcb-aea48ccc2ae6.2874c416-1c99-430a-a1ae-30540eac7ddb","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.36476.9007199266251261.5257d7f6-3b50-4a13-8cac-b0c1a4137f36.9dcda65f-13b2-424e-9f1d-9e0f77cd0548","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Gratis⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.0,"RatingsCount":"82","PackageFamilyNames":["828B5831.VirtualCity2ParadiseResort_ytsefhwckbdv6"],"ContentIds":["5264bd9b-6672-8ad9-e0cc-8c5d7876da7b"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"Pc","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"LONG-AWAITED SEQUEL TO VIRTUAL CITY IS FINALLY HERE! \r\nNew buildings, new product chains, new challenges!

Om de koning te overmeesteren moet hij schaakmat gezet worden.  Als de koning niet op eigen kracht kan ontsnappen, of met behulp van zijn pionnen, staat hij schaakmat en is hij overmeesterd.\r\n \r\nHet schaakspel van ZingMagic heeft vele prijzen gewonnen en staat bekend om het enorme speelvermogen voor spelers op allerlei niveaus, van beginners tot experts.

Almost all issues are trivial and can be solved right away. We usually answer within 24 hours.\r\n\r\nSpeechToText Pro is a professional speech-to-text app designed for generating longer pieces of content. Create articles, essays, even ebooks, only using Voice Typing. Never again touch the mouse and keyboard, or touchscreen, when using this speech-to-text software!\r\n\r\nAlthough it is 100% accurate most of the time, its real power lies in the flexible voice commands - referred to as Actions - that let you control all aspects of text presentation. Use them to make any correction or change the presentation of any segment of text.\r\n\r\nSome of the Actions are... Select, Select From/Until, Select Last Word, Select Last Sentence, Select Previous, Select Next, Insert Before, Insert After, Delete, Delete Last Word, Delete Last Sentence, Capitalize, Uppercase, Lowercase, Round Bracket, Double Quote, Single Quote, Hyphenate, Join, Reverse, Acronymize, Spell, and more. You can also create bulleted lists easilty. Usage of Actions and all other features is illustrated by example in video tutorials, accessible from inside the app. There is also a user guide on Actions that can be printed and downloaded.\r\n\r\nIn fact, this description - as is - was voice typed using SpeechToText Pro and Actions.\r\n\r\nSpeechToText Pro will not do the following:\r\n\r\n1. Work without internet.\r\n\r\n2. Produce good results without a high-quality USB microphone. (For more details, see Resources -> Best Results.)\r\n\r\n3. Produce accurate results in the presence of background noise.\r\n\r\n4. Transcribe speeches delivered from a distant source, such as a public speaker.\r\n\r\n5. Convert audio files into text.\r\n\r\n6. Produce audio recordings. This is strictly a speech-to-text app! (Well, it does text-to-speech as well.)\r\n\r\nHere is what SpeechToText Pro does. It:\r\n\r\n1) Converts spoken words into text at the rate of natural speech, and at near-100% accuracy.\r\n\r\n2) Lets you modify existing text, or define the presentation of the text you are pronouncing, through the use of voice commands. Voice commands replace the mouse and keyboard. However, the option to modify text using those methods exists too.\r\n\r\n3) Lets you substitute the predefined voice commands with your own.\r\n\r\n4) Offers support for hotkeys. Simply assign a voice command to a difficult-to-pronounce segment of text. Then pronounce the voice command for the difficult-to-pronounce text to print.\r\n\r\n5) Lets you save text, send it as an email, send it as an SMS message, share it to other apps, upload it to OneDrive, play it back in a synthetic voice, or print it.\r\n\r\n6) Makes it convenient to paraphrase spoken content in Youtube videos.\r\n\r\n7) Lets you do scientific calculator-level calculations with its voice-driven calculator.\r\n\r\n8) Helps you protect your content by defining users. \r\n\r\n9) Lets you produce richly formatted content that can be saved as an RTF file, PDF file, or printed.\r\n\r\n10) Works in English, Mandarin, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese & Spanish.  \r\n\r\nAlthough SpeechToText Pro has a learning curve, it is minimized thanks to its intuitive design, easy-to-read documentation, and the fact that every control (button, switch, menu) throughout the user interface is documented with a tooltip. Every major component of the app has its own user guide. The user guide on Actions can also be saved or printed. The information in the user guides is complemented by video tutorials, accessible through Resources -> Video Tutorials.\r\n\r\nIt is in the user's best interest to learn all the features of SpeechToText Pro so that this Windows 10 speech to text app can be used in its fullest potential.\r\n\r\nSpeechToText Pro has a free 24-hour trial period and then a price of $6.49. Positive reviews help this app continue improving. We also welcome user feedback! Many of the app's present features started out as feature requests. If there is a feature you would like to see implemented, please send an email to admin@hasfocus.com.

(Nikon D-xxxx WITHOUT Snapbridge) *** A few Coolpix models and other Nikon compacts like Nikon 1 may also work. P900, D500 and crippled Snapbridge models do NOT work for sure. Use the one day free trial to test yours before buying.\r\n\r\nWirelessly download images you marked as \"Send to smart device\" on your WIFI (not Bluetooth) capable Nikon DSLR camera. Alternatively you can select the photos to download using a simple thumbnail overview. You can also remotely trigger the shutter release button, just like with an IR remote. Great for quickly sharing photos on the go via mobile, or for selfies.\r\nYou can also synchronize your Nikon cameras time from your device.\r\n\r\nPlease mention: it is fastest to select the images to download in your camera. The app just picks up the list you selected in the Nikons Wifi menu (see app web page or your cameras manual for details). The alternative selection by thumbnail in the app might show un-rotated thumbs with black border in some cameras. This is a Nikon problem.\r\nBulb mode is not supported.\r\n\r\nUse the one day free trial to test if the app is working fine with your camera. Most larger DSLRs will do, most smaller models will not be compatible, or not with all features. Please do no post bad review because your camera is not supported- I cannot support them. The trial app will not start after one day, which is not a bug.\r\n \r\nMake sure you updated your camera to the latest firmware. Also do not switch off your mobile while transferring (though nothing bad should happen).\r\nIf your camera is not supported, please do not issue bad reviews. It won't help, I cannot support more cameras because Nikon does not give me more technical information.\r\n\r\nThe app supports downloading your NEF raw files in maximum quality. You can edit them on the go with apps like Rawer or Fhotoroom.\r\n\r\nBuy once, and as a Windows 10 Universal App it will work across all your Windows 10 devices.\r\n\r\nThis app is NOT affiliated with Nikon Corp.","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4XV76","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Dutch Public Broadcasting","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13529.13510798887696679.31920f86-b330-4833-b324-5a870ad8fb3d.1eb89e44-7998-4688-91c2-3743b39a6877","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5485.13510798887696679.465e69e0-ccfe-46f0-9115-3483ffa60393.349f6656-31a3-4bde-a71c-ff7bba725ca0","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.65282.13510798887696679.4a0e1c0c-1257-4e02-97ab-2a5c81733585.a4e58b9a-0caf-44a0-a941-a41f6eafd3cd","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32526.13510798887696679.a7ca4fab-87ce-42b4-b6c3-c3e4ae69dd98.672239c2-e1b6-4fe7-a72e-d22d7c15d981","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22079.13510798887696679.5b574ec8-b0ef-4d17-8787-f2b00c357787.c8037665-92a1-4963-b9b1-80efe3fbb5da","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50331.13510798887696679.814de2e4-658c-422d-a8ab-784b15bec05a.10548825-376d-4e37-aa9a-5e2059e76ffb","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39565.13510798887696679.881444e9-35cf-4b02-9c94-7c81648002b2.670fd2f8-fe5e-457a-8a28-6dea69168c9e","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59439.13510798887696679.f6735262-87d3-4bbf-b52a-a02e7ddb5d80.76a905df-8b33-4349-b66d-b95fad2eb67f","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56328.13510798887696679.a958579a-789f-445c-a7ee-997caf61030f.e109034a-83c1-43da-9ca9-d118ef4c267a","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Gratis⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.7,"RatingsCount":"13","PackageFamilyNames":["GoedWare.DutchPublicBroadcasting_3hrefr76w9cej"],"ContentIds":["80b0267b-474d-060e-3246-b61718f0954f","5dadf802-65b8-e60e-9daa-b3523ed3e09f"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"Pc,Xbox One,Mobiel","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Dutch Public Broadcasting (DPB) is een onofficiële app waarmee je on-demand programma's kan kijken van de NPO (Nederlandse Publieke Omroep).\r\n\r\nMet DPB kun je tv-programma’s van de publieke omroep terugkijken.

It's just like working with the real circuit. You do not stop to take a measurement or spend a lot of time configuring reports. Instead, you just play with the circuit as you normally would, with the power on!\r\n\r\nThere are over 30 elements you can use to build your circuits. The app has everything from simple resistors, to switches, to MOSFETs, to digital gates.\r\n\r\nThe app features a multimeter that you use to probe around the circuit to instantly read voltages and currents. If you want to see how a value changes over time, then you can add values to the built-in oscilloscope. The scope can simultaneously track many signals over time and features a touch interface to control the total time displayed and stacked and unstacked modes to easily compare signals.\r\n\r\nSupported elements include:\r\n◾ Signal generators, Voltage sources, and Current sources\r\n◾ Resistors, Capacitors, and inductors\r\n◾ Manual SPST/SPDT Switches, and SPST/SPDT relays\r\n◾ Diodes, LEDs, BJ Transistors, and MOSFETs\r\n◾ ADCs, and DACs\r\n◾ Logic gates: AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR\r\n◾ JK and D Flip-flops\r\n◾ And much more...","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NV6P5WFT5ML","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Master Adobe Indesign","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17465.14400209638088111.adb33968-3cac-40e3-90dd-ccf8fad7e417.869a0d87-a55a-40ed-8dbd-0e9a7051e589","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2675.14400209638088111.a528b767-3a6d-40d8-8681-abdae8535ed4.4ff53024-86fb-449d-8640-2a2c8b6c8374","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18285.14400209638088111.d3923b3c-9ddd-4e00-8e13-a1997f52b79f.9018fe34-6451-4175-b7c0-2fd13e471c26","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6273.14400209638088111.4d2bba47-4493-4f29-ae35-1b2e2a06023a.bc68ee24-c1b5-40f9-bdf8-251c05382219","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39096.14400209638088111.cc68c2a2-51c4-421f-ae26-6640a48f8682.8fcfeb3b-c011-4e85-971e-2392f5cc6e28","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4050.14400209638088111.44c1fe41-714e-4ce8-8e17-df8bd3624342.badc7c1e-7a8f-4af8-abcd-5e9ed58f5912","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"€ 5,99","Price":5.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["8635ApproachApplications.MasterAdobeIndesign_jnpw9xmhc8mta"],"ContentIds":["49ac80bd-ec93-27e1-eafa-6e7ba04c6419"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"Pc,HoloLens,Mobiel","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Adobe InDesign is used to create works such as posters, flyers, brochures, magazines, newspapers, presentations, books and ebooks.\r\n\r\nThis collection of 500 plus video guides will soon get you up and running with Adobe InDesign.\r\n\r\nGetting the most out of it takes some doing and this app with it's 500 plus!

Complemented by articles on connected myths and history, this is the most comprehensive collection of information on constellations.*\r\n\r\nREAL-TIME MOTION TRACKING\r\nAs you hold your phone up and point it towards the sky, Star Walk 2 follows your motions using the built-in gyroscope to match the map on your screen to the stars seen from your location. Easily find any star, constellation, or satellite in the sky by tapping Search. Star Walk will indicate the direction to look in. \r\n\r\nNEW POINT OF VIEW\r\nUnlike on a plain photograph, every star in Star Walk 2 has coordinates. That means you can look at objects, for instance, a constellation from any vantage point in space, not to mention the ultimate accuracy of your map for your exact location. \r\n\r\nNOW AND LATER \r\nStar Walk 2 gives you accurate daily data on current moon phase, time of sunset and sunrise, and elevation of planets. With just one slide you can see how the sky will look later tonight or throughout the year. \r\n\r\nPRO STARGAZING\r\nSpecial night-time soft red mode will help you preserve night vision when stargazing with a telescope. You can see the sky in X-Ray (and 5 more filters) to study the invisible structure of the universe. Live tracking for over 8,000 satellites will help you catch iridium flares, and detailed articles will satisfy the most curious inquirer.","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4TRCM","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Olympus Rising: Hero Defense","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64455.13510798887612598.617c41cb-7076-4761-857e-de26cdb39580.6b017157-dbaa-43e5-9854-4c8ccb70dec1","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58412.13510798887612598.617c41cb-7076-4761-857e-de26cdb39580.b9a9d0d2-b66b-46ce-9120-637bde56cd68","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17474.13510798887612598.b6bb054a-1b5e-4c52-9911-92db98bba24a.b2f1b339-a72c-4236-b7c4-32eee1ed5401","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9623.13510798887612598.58af8917-e6c4-495f-b44c-7b34c8c26c58.5bc1c312-4c16-4801-bd1f-520031219d3d","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64455.13510798887612598.617c41cb-7076-4761-857e-de26cdb39580.6b017157-dbaa-43e5-9854-4c8ccb70dec1","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Gratis⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.7,"RatingsCount":"10","PackageFamilyNames":["flaregamesGmbH.OlympusRising_g0q0z3kw54rap"],"ContentIds":["7e27b898-d668-d1fa-e99a-f0b999508d28","4fb77dd2-edb1-1302-52a3-8020adfda6bb"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"Pc,HoloLens,Mobiel","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"“Olympus Rising features striking 3D visuals and the presentation is brilliant…The narrative of the game is impressive, and leading your army through the enemy defenses is great fun with seamless controls.” - ONMSFT\r\n\r\nDownload Olympus Rising now, and prove that you have what it takes to become a god in this cutting-edge action-strategy game!\r\n \r\n- Fight large-scale battles with hundreds of units\r\n- Customise your unique team of Heroes with almost infinite variations of powerful loot\r\n- Recruit fantastic beasts from Greek myth and legend\r\n- Build a fabulous city on Mount Olympus\r\n- Strategically design your defenses to defeat attacking players\r\n- Form an unbeatable Alliance and fight epic campaigns in the Alliance Wars\r\n \r\n- - - Terms of Service and Privacy Policy - - -\r\nBy accessing or using a Flaregames product, you're agreeing to our Terms of Service (www.flaregames.com/terms-service/) and Privacy Policy (http://www.flaregames.com/privacy-policy/).\r\n\r\n- - - Parental Guide - - -\r\nOlympus Rising is free to download and play, however some game items can also be purchased for real money.

Relax on the couch and enjoy coloring a complex design, a vacation spot, or a crazy cartoon cat - tons of pages to choose from.  Even color the same picture more than once, to see what else you can do with it.  No need to worry about losing your coloring pencils in the couch anymore!\r\n\r\nThe app comes with one free coloring book, and other books are available as small in-app purchases.  Books are created by indie artists, so all of them have a unique feel and style.  New books are being added all the time, so keep checking back in the in-app store to see what's been published lately.  Half of the proceeds from every in app purchase goes directly to the artist, so keep 'em drawing if you like their stuff!\r\n\r\nColorist also works with a mouse, pen and touch.  Coloring with your finger is fine, but a pressure sensitive stylus is what Colorist was designed for and where it truly shines.  The app is fully functional in the free version - the only purchases are any extra coloring books you choose to buy.\r\n\r\nIf you're an artist and want to submit a book for colorist, reach out at submissions@factionapps.com.  We're always looking for awesome new pages!\r\n\r\nSome of the cool stuff:\r\n- No need to lug around a coloring book and manage a bunch of pencils - its all there on your tablet!\r\n- Blend, shade, and even erase (something your coloring pencils won't do!)\r\n- Automatically stay inside the lines - for when you're feeling impatient!\r\n- Support an indie artist and feel good!  Half of the in app purchase proceeds go straight to the artist.  \r\n- Keep as many colored pages on the go as you want, they'll all be right where you left them.\r\n- Create your own masterpiece sketches, when you're feeling especially creative!","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDGZ0D","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"LiveATC","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.21033.9007199266328663.3d6def9a-3beb-4679-85e8-e17a663b0a6d.27bc51a9-ac67-4ca5-9a95-3b5813e4009a","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#1c4b93","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20929.9007199266328663.3023d17c-0f84-48c7-9755-a424fbcd493c.3f9cdc7f-6d84-48ea-a1f7-8aa90e3e56e2","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#1c4b93","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.65328.9007199266328663.dd0e4ffd-8ab9-404d-bb69-82708a49d628.7e31469b-c1ef-446e-af6e-b807c473df78","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#1c4b93","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34843.9007199266328663.e19b8ef1-ac24-4281-8f5b-52a09ab7d853.8e2ee0c9-c7f4-4608-a2c7-c6acd18ab6e9","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#1c4b93","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.16403.9007199266328663.938b9a4b-e6a4-4585-83f0-0d091d876ee9.aec2c506-263d-4b75-8b24-10666dda4c4e","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#1c4b93","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13711.9007199266328663.9262370f-2fc2-4d31-b5e5-5a84ccffe460.8b9a4b00-5ad1-495b-80b4-695e047ada55","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#1c4b93","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"€ 3,99","Price":3.99,"AverageRating":4.4,"RatingsCount":"5","PackageFamilyNames":["LiveATC.net.LiveATC_0yfybvjjn1ddw"],"ContentIds":["9d784388-c089-5f84-56e6-1d0020ef5aaa","3d0277f6-51cb-a48d-545d-89b1b37f6f5c"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"Pc,Mobiel","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Stuck in the airport terminal with endless delays?

Het is fundamenteel verschillend van de meeste solitaire games in dat zeer weinig handen zijn onoplosbaar. Hoewel software-implementaties variëren meeste versies etiket handen van een aantal (afgeleid van het willekeuriggetalkiem gebruikt om de handen te genereren).\r\n\r\nEen versie van FreeCell werd gemaakt door Microsoft voor een release met het Windows-besturingssysteem.\r\n\r\nFreeCell solitaire is een soort grappige solitaire kaartspel, maar het is niet zoals andere solitaires. Je moet geen geluk om te winnen, wordt alleen vaardigheid vereist. Alle kaarten zijn geopend vanaf het begin en de deal heeft de oplossing, je kunt winnen, denken en verstandig bewegen.\r\n\r\nBelangrijkste kenmerken:\r\n- Deals met verschillende moeilijkheidsgraden\r\n- Elke voltooide deal heeft score\r\n- Aanpasbare achtergrond en kaart\r\n- Magnetische kaart beweging\r\n- Supermove: multiple card slepen\r\n- Sleep of tik te verplaatsen\r\n- Undo optie\r\n- Optimaal gebruik van de batterij voor zeer lang gameplay\r\n\r\nReglement\r\nBouw en inrichting\r\nEen standaard 52-card deck wordt gebruikt.\r\nEr zijn vier open cellen en vier open stichtingen. Sommige alternatieve regels gebruiken tussen 09:59 cellen.\r\nDe kaarten worden gedeeld in acht watervallen, waarvan er vier bestaan ​​uit zeven kaarten en vier van die bestaat uit zes. Sommige alternatieve regels zullen gebruiken tussen 09:56 watervallen.\r\n\r\nGebouw tijdens het afspelen\r\nDe bovenste kaart van elk cascade begint een tableau.\r\nTableaux moet omlaag worden gebouwd door afwisselende kleuren.\r\nStichtingen zijn opgebouwd door pak.\r\n\r\nMoves\r\nElke cel kaart of bovenste kaart van elk cascade kan worden verplaatst naar bouwen op een tableau, of verplaatst naar een lege cel, een lege cascade, of de stichting.\r\nVolledige of gedeeltelijke tableaus kunnen worden verplaatst om voort te bouwen op bestaande tableaus, of verplaatst naar lege cascades, door recursief het plaatsen en verwijderen van kaarten door middel van tussenliggende locaties. Computer implementaties tonen vaak deze beweging, maar spelers met fysieke decks bewegen doorgaans het tableau in een keer.\r\n\r\nOverwinning\r\nHet spel wordt gewonnen nadat alle kaarten worden verplaatst naar de funderingspalen.\r\nVerschillende computer versies van Freecell soms omgaan onoplosbaar games.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeschiedenis\r\nEen van de oudste voorouders van FreeCell is Acht Off. In het juni 1968 nummer van Scientific American, Martin Gardner beschreven zijn column \"Mathematical Games\" een spel door CL Baker die vergelijkbaar FreeCell, behalve dat kaarten op het tableau zijn gebouwd op kleur niet door afwisselende kleuren. Gardner schreef: \"Het spel werd geleerd om Baker door zijn vader, die op zijn beurt leerde het van een Engelsman in de jaren 1920.\" Deze variant wordt nu genaamd Baker's Game. FreeCell de oorsprong kan dateren nog verder terug tot 1945 en een Scandinavisch spel genaamd Napoleon in St. Helena (niet het spel Napoleon op St. Helena, ook bekend als Forty Thieves).\r\n\r\nPaul Alfille veranderd Baker's Game van het maken van kaarten te bouwen volgens afwisselende kleuren, waardoor FreeCell. Hij voerde de eerste geautomatiseerde versie van het in de TUTOR programmeertaal voor de PLATO educatieve computersysteem in 1978. Alfille was in staat om gemakkelijk herkenbare grafische beelden van het spelen van kaarten op de 512 * 512 monochroom display op het PLATO systemen weer te geven.\r\n\r\nDeze originele FreeCell milieu toegestaan ​​games met 4C10 kolommen en 1C10 cellen in aanvulling op de standaard 8 * 4 spel. Voor elke variant, het programma opgeslagen een ranglijst van de spelers met de langste winnende strepen. Er was ook een toernooi systeem dat mogen mensen om te concurreren om te winnen moeilijk met de hand geplukt deals. Paul Alfille beschrijft dit vroege FreeCell omgeving meer in detail in een interview uit 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\nSolver complexiteit\r\nDe FreeCell spel heeft een constant aantal kaarten. Dit houdt in dat in constante tijd, een persoon of een computer kan al het mogelijke zetten daarvan een lijst van een bepaalde start configuratie en ontdek een winnende reeks van bewegingen of, ervan uitgaande dat het spel niet kan worden opgelost, het ontbreken. Om een ​​interessante complexiteit analyse moet men een gegeneraliseerde versie van het spel FreeCell te bouwen met 4 * n kaarten uit te voeren. Deze algemene versie van het spel is NP-compleet; Het is onwaarschijnlijk dat een algoritme efficiënter dan een brute-force search bestaat dat oplossingen voor willekeurige gegeneraliseerde FreeCell configuraties kunnen vinden.\r\n\r\nEr zijn 52! (Dwz 52 faculteit), of ongeveer 8 * 1067, verschillende deals. Echter, sommige games zijn effectief identiek aan anderen omdat pakken toegewezen aan kaarten zijn willekeurig of kolommen kunnen worden verwisseld. Na het nemen van deze factoren rekening wordt gehouden, zijn er ongeveer 1,75 * 1064 verschillende spelletjes.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N29TP7ZMKV3","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Air File Viewer: Open Word,PDF,PowerPoint,Video & Image","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40758.13955707631967756.552b21d2-6c62-4b48-8335-ead4f5bffdec.d78f211f-fc87-4a23-accf-ecfe0e977cdb","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#2980CC","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.11994.13955707631967756.552b21d2-6c62-4b48-8335-ead4f5bffdec.8b97c634-de29-4c6e-aac3-66b1f8803758","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#2980CC","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32069.13955707631967756.552b21d2-6c62-4b48-8335-ead4f5bffdec.1ca08ece-6182-4b59-891c-867f7bd9d7c2","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#2980CC","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Gratis","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.8,"RatingsCount":"43","PackageFamilyNames":["20815shootingapp.AirFileViewer_xcg28tkrsnqww"],"ContentIds":["b14e39e8-1766-1fd0-f0b0-0a06bdbbe24d","27a8c143-135d-d667-a891-b7d8216bab59"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"Pc","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Air File Viewer allows you to view any file on your PC.
