You create a new astronaut, gain levels and experience for every move you make by completing missions in space. You will have access to missions similar to what happened in real life, or fictional missions designed to challenge you as an astronaut.\r\n\r\nSpacecrafts are highly complicated machines with the primary task of exploring and understanding what's outside the atmosphere of Earth, while keeping the astronauts alive for long periods. This is achieved by hundreds of individual systems and backup systems working together. With the help from the in-game Space Flight Academy, the provided flight manual for each spacecraft, and checklists, you will learn how to fly and operate these machines, and explore space in a high resolution and realistic environment.\r\n\r\nControl almost every system like the real astronauts, see the sunset and sunrise while orbiting orbiting Earth with speeds exceeding 25,500 ft/s. Explore the surface of Earth and the Moon with high resolution textures, or simply enjoy the solitude of being in space.\r\n\r\nImagine the final few seconds before launching into space. You are sitting on top of a 111 meter high rocket, looking at the instruments of a spaceship about to leave the oasis we call Earth. The engines are igniting, mechanical systems are clinging below you, while thousands of gallons of fuel is pumping through the systems. The loud roar of the five F1 engines are producing close to 8,000,000 pounds of thrust, violently shaking the cockpit and lifting 3 million kg off the pad. The launch pad tower is slowly moving away from you while the engines are balancing the rocket like a skyscraper on a needle. Sophisticated engineers has created the systems that will safely accelerate you to 25,500 ft/s, into a free fall orbit, with the Moon as the destination.\r\n\r\nWelcome to Reentry, an orbital simulator.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH3V5S4","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Gods of Rome","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46773.13510798884708367.5b0be3cd-5c06-4a87-8c8c-12c0090ed6cf.759cdf50-7d6f-4ad9-afdb-ab1803427cd2","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17580.13510798884708367.f4b1a691-625b-4fe8-a61b-e81f330bcc85.1c12d2da-8465-4797-9be0-33becda4a411","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47202.13510798884708367.2a6ca7b7-879d-49cc-8b45-f6385ea43fd9.623b8f10-bbb1-471f-807b-77c135cc11fd","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31752.13510798884708367.5359cb81-a143-4c4e-89e2-92b03b12f97b.0d0d4bf7-7096-49a7-97cd-b0c453b8c8f4","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64487.13510798884708367.61fd1e42-70b7-45f2-b6d4-f99dd1755b1b.79ae0431-4b13-4ab4-95c3-de3e0e8decca","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.5,"RatingsCount":"222","PackageFamilyNames":["A278AB0D.GodsofRome_h6adky7gbf63m"],"ContentIds":["6afd029f-596b-69c0-ed5c-ec3a0f280af4","30a48ea3-52b6-c19c-ad04-296652d80b44"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"An epic fighting game set in an age of myth and legend that’s designed to offer a stunning experience!\r\nThe souls of the most powerful gods have been summoned to brutal battle.

The unique “sketch” mode allows single-click styling of any figure as if it is sketched by hand.\r\n\r\nYou can create basic shapes and connections very quickly thanks to the freehand drawing recognition. For complex drawings, there are hundreds of ready-to-use stencils on the toolbox that can be easily dragged to the canvas. Most of these stencils are not just static images, but complex objects with plenty of properties setting up their appearance and behavior in the designer.\r\n\r\nApplication was developed to take advantage of the entire set of devices from powerful workstations and top ultrabooks to hybrids and smallest tablets. It provides great user experience with all types of inputs – touch and pen, mouse and keyboard without sacrificing any editing capabilities of the desktop software.\r\n\r\n\r\n*** Buy it once and use on all your Windows devices. You can save hundreds on separate licenses! ***\r\n\r\n\r\n Grapholite can be used for:\r\n• Flow charts;\r\n• Swimlanes;\r\n• Organizational charts;\r\n• Uml diagrams;\r\n• Web site structures and wireframes;\r\n• Application’s interface sketches (ui mockups);\r\n• Computer network layouts (including Cisco networks);\r\n• Floor plans (office layouts, building plans, home plans etc.);\r\n• Business process models (both bpmn 1.2 and bpmn 2.0 notations are supported);\r\n• Mind maps and brainstorming diagrams;\r\n• Venn charts and set charts;\r\n• Data flow diagrams;\r\n• Process flow diagrams;\r\n• Workflows;\r\n• Chevron and circular diagrams;\r\n• Swot analysis;\r\n• Scientific illustrations;\r\n• Graphs, algorithms, schemes;\r\n• Planograms;\r\n• Infographics.\r\n\r\nYou can start working on a diagram in the field using only touch and pen and finish the document in the office in the most comfortable environment with the help of habitual mouse and keyboard. On hybrid devices and productivity tablets such as Microsoft Surface you even won’t need to restart the application!\r\n\r\nThe app provides a unique set of shape behaviors for each diagram type. For example, windows and doors will automatically connect to walls in floor plans; shapes support automatic layout of children and collapsing\\expanding of the hierarchy levels in org charts and mind maps. Connections auto-routing logic also depends on the diagram type.\r\n\r\nObjects tree pane allows you to inspect, select, lock and hide all visual objects.\r\n\r\nPrint, share, export your diagrams and insert them in your web-sites, blog posts, publications, articles, documents, spreadsheets, presentations and other media.\r\n\r\nGrapholite supports export to Pdf, Png, Jpeg, Svg and Microsoft Visio (Vdx) formats.

the award-winning, smash-hit, indie game The Escapists with the worldwide phenomenon that is The Walking Dead, comes The Escapists: The Walking Dead. In this unique game, recreated entirely in the charming 8-bit pixel art style of The Escapists, you play as Rick Grimes as he takes on hordes of zombies let loose upon the world.  \r\n\r\nRick is in charge of a band of survivors featuring many of the original comic book cast, including Maggie, Hershel, Glenn and Michonne.  Rick must secure the safety of the group by seeking out a safe escape route from each area, and manage several dangerous tasks to keep as many of the group alive as possible. The game faithfully matches the timeline of the comics, meaning Rick must first fight his way out of the Harrison Memorial Hospital, visit the Greene family farm before visiting destinations such as the Meirwether Correctional Facility and Woodbury.\r\n\r\nProtect the living and escape the dead as you play through the award-winning comic's epic story.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NX2D8G1X4VK","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Fitbit Coach","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30711.14438396411231226.de295912-c5b9-45c7-9e58-66d49297960a.4d8b67bd-e8e6-461b-a262-ecc279db2be7","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#00b0b9","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52692.14438396411231226.5b0c60bb-41c7-4c02-8cdf-b0f54c2661ea.8572a506-94a5-44bd-beef-3365a6aff73f","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#00b0b9","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53261.14438396411231226.6c9b3d79-bf08-44d9-94d4-e982aa1eb8d2.f7417632-2d70-4f0a-9039-0f814a2364aa","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#00b0b9","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.21785.14438396411231226.ba6f8f43-754d-4460-b931-faba2a4ef9b3.4a01adf1-2141-4db5-9c14-a37054d76f09","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28780.14438396411231226.4a9e1125-b119-470e-9729-c49ee2a2958d.296d0da9-b270-417e-b61e-464d9e0bfdfc","Height":2160,"Width":1440,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.7,"RatingsCount":"10","PackageFamilyNames":["Fitbit.FitbitCoach_6mqt6hf9g46tw"],"ContentIds":["e7c77068-3792-3292-120b-85a96165d7da","0195a11b-e333-d503-bb33-5f41d3b2beb5"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"   ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Xbox One,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"The Fitbit Coach personalized training app helps you stay motivated to reach your health & fitness goals, from getting stronger to losing a few pounds, with expert-designed dynamic bodyweight, run, and walk workouts that continually adjust to your feedback, goals, and capabilities -- just like a personal trainer!

Now featuring Hue Disco and immersive Camera, Screen and Light sync utilizing Philips Entertainment!\r\n\r\nFeel energized or relaxed with professionally designed experiences combining light and sound. Over 40 mixable and dynamic scenes with simple room and lighting group control, such as mountain chill, fireplace, jungle night, fire and ice, rainforest, fireworks and many more!\r\n\r\nHave the ultimate party with multiple advanced sound to light disco modes. Adjust strobe, intensity, hue and more! The best on Windows 10 and supports anything you play on your device, i.e Spotify, YouTube etc!\r\n\r\nIncludes Cortana support. Control your lights with simple commands, such as \"Hey Cortana, lights off in the kitchen.\" or \"Hey Cortana, start fireplace in the living room for 20 minutes\".\r\n\r\nCamera support means you can point your device at your TV and sync your lights to your viewing for a truly immersive experience! Movie night has never been so good. Enjoy two user selectable sampling modes, predominant multicolored and average color. Speed and brightness control is also supported. (NOT FOR XBOX)\r\n\r\nCreate your own custom photo ambiences and enhance the colors with our \"Tweaks!\". Photo ambiences are stored on the Hue bridge with our OmniScene technology, meaning you don't have to recreate the ambience for different rooms. Not only that, they are accessible from all your devices - the only app on Windows 10 to have this functionality!\r\n\r\nMake your Hue Dimmer and Tap devices more useful with our advanced programming interface, with much more functionality that the official Philips Hue app and the best on Windows 10. Unlock features such as multiple actions per button, toggle power with one button, cycle through ambiences, enable and disable color loop, cycle through brightness levels and much much more!\r\n\r\nEver come home to have all your Hue lights on 100% brightness because of even a slight power outage or “brownout”? With the hueDynamic app, this is a thing of the past thanks to our Hue System Power Cut detection. With a simple click, you can enable this feature in the hueDynamic app and your Hue Bridge will be programmed to recognize when its power has been disturbed. As soon as it has finished booting, it will then send a command to your lights and bulbs to switch them off for you automatically. This gives you piece of mind and also saves on electricity costs.\r\n\r\nOur Hue Motion Sensor programming is powerful and easy to use. Completely customize the actions your motion sensors perform and specify variable timeouts for different times of the day or night.

\r\n\r\nPicture in Picture (Pip)\r\n--------------------------\r\nWith Pip you have endless possibilities, you can watch two live streams at the same time, or you can watch a movie while casting another one to your kid’s TV. Imagine what you can do when you can play, cast and record multiple media content at the same time.\r\n\r\nCasting\r\n---------\r\nWith Duplex Media Player, casting is never been easier.

It doesn’t matter whether you want to cast online stream or locally stored media content. Duplex Media Player will cast any media to any device even if the device doesn’t support it (for example, Chromecast doesn’t support .FLV files, with Duplex Media Player you can now cast .FLV and other files to Chromecast devices)\r\n\r\nIn addition, if you have a slow network connection, or your media content was encoded with a high bit rate which is not suitable for casting, Duplex Media Player can generate a ready to cast copy which is suitable for casting and smooth playing.\r\n\r\nSubtitles\r\n----------\r\nIn addition to loading local subtitles, Duplex Media Player can automatically search and download subtitles for you. You can also configure the appearance of the subtitles. In addition, time correction feature will allow you to adjust subtitle times.\r\n\r\nRecordings & Downloads\r\n------------------------------\r\nWith a single tap, you can start and stop recording easily.

You don’t have to install any external codecs.  If you try to play .rm or .flv or any other format that is not supported in Windows 10, then Duplex Media Player is what you are looking for.\r\n\r\n\r\n*** All features of this app are free except

At the Maya artifact exhibition, one of the exhibits suddenly started to move. The sound drew the attention of a young woman named Diana, a museum employee and an expert in Mayan culture. When she came closer to the artifact she realized it looked like a portal... and suddenly some unknown power lifted her up and teleported her to an ancient temple! Now Diana has to figure out where she is, how she got there and how she's going to return home. The young woman encounters a civilization similar to the Mayan culture, but this is neither the past nor a parallel reality.
