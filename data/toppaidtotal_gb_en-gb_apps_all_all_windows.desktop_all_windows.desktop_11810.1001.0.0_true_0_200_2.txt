It's also a great way for grownups to clear one's mind, or get into that trance or meditative state when thoughts can ramble around as they want.  \r\nYou can play Wall Ball in standard mode, with a pretty fast ball, or in easy mode with a rather large and slower moving ball, or you can even play in seated mode, suitable for people with some physical impairment or if you just feel very tired.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL STUFF:\r\nBefore starting the game, Make sure you have the Kinect camera (sensor) properly installed on your computer. Follow instructions from Microsoft website to install Kinect and the necessary SDK software  http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44561 \r\nTo use Kinect for Xbox One on your computer, you need the Kinect Adapter for Windows. After installation of the Kinect software you should be able to see the Kinect for Windows SDK v2.0 in your app menu. \r\nFind a good spot to play where the Kinect camera can view you from head to feet. You can easily check this with the software that follows with the installation of the Kinect SDK software. You can for instance run Kinect Studio v2.0 (under Kinect for Windows SDK v2.0) to view yourself in front of the Kinect.\r\nIf everything looks ok, then you can start the Wall Ball game.\r\nIt can be recommended to connect your computer to a larger monitor or TV screen (using a HDMI cable) to  improve the \"feel\" of the game and making it easier to see.\r\n\r\nGENERAL SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS:\r\n•\tFree the space around you to not hurt yourself or to break any furniture. (Think about arms could be waving upwards too.)\r\n•\tIf children are playing they should be supervised and instructed by parents to not hurt themselves bumping into furniture.\r\n•\tIf other people are present in the room, make sure they are not in front of the camera and that they are at a safe distance from you bumping in to them.\r\n•\tIf you experience problem with balance, consider sitting down when playing.\r\n\r\nQUICK START\r\nBefore you start, make sure Kinect is properly installed and you have tested a good spot for playing where the Kinect sensor can \"read\" you properly, see above under \"Technical stuff\". If you have two graphic cards on your system, run the game with the better card otherwise it can affect Kinect/game performance. (For example, if you have a nvidia card you can manage this in nvidia control panel, manage 3D settings.)\r\nStart the game by pressing the Wall Ball icon.\r\nFrom the Main Menu (start screen), choose one of the three game variants Standard or Easy version or if you would like to sit down and play, choose Seated mode. The ball is somewhat larger and slower in Easy and Seated mode.\r\nWith the Toggle Show Settings (down at the right corner), you can adjust for your camera's placement above the floor. It is recommended to fine tune this. If the camera height setting are too low, you will feel like your feet are really heavy and won't lift properly. If it's to high, your feet will float in the air. The camera height slider correspond to the Kinect sensor's placement above the floor, however if it is tilted, you may have to adjust the slider more.\r\nStand in front of the Kinect camera, let the camera know you're there by moving slightly. When camera has found you, start kicking.\r\nKick the ball by using your right or left foot. When aiming, remember this is virtual reality so aim in a real world scale, not just in a small tv screen scale, that is, play like you were in the park yourself facing a large wall about 4 meters in front of you.\r\nIf the ball touches the area right behind you (an area as wide as the yellow area you're standing on) you will lose one ball. \r\nTo prevent the ball from hitting this area, you can stop the ball with your \"body\", shown as a silhouette, or just use your feet. You can slide from side to side inside the yellow area and crunch (you can't really move forward or backward, only as far as your legs can reach).\r\n\r\nIf you have lost all of your five balls, the game will end and you can choose to save, restart or exit. You choose between alternatives by putting your foot in one of the boxes, in this way you can restart instantly if you would like without the need to reach for the computer. You can also click on the signs with the mouse. From the Start screen, you can click on Result Menu where you can view your results.\r\n\r\nVideo tutorial: https://youtu.be/qFTv-q2cccg\r\nPDF tutorial: http://www.mixxusstudio.com/game-production/kinect-games\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH5SP5V","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"The Walking Dead: Michonne","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22828.13510798887339475.897b392c-fd9b-4d4e-8cc2-413fd5efe0b9.dd2ecd2b-b1f1-431b-b1e0-6307941fdf69","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#336699","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60725.13510798887339475.4f88008a-9bd2-4197-8f99-671e6e7c9e95.8bd569b1-6804-4fc4-a991-2475baec5fbe","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#336699","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17824.13510798887339475.3241771c-7400-4f23-b191-a64966b28d4b.3f4dd314-6a4c-48c5-bef5-e8407e80ec3e","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#336699","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20506.13510798887339475.e18a24bf-4479-48b2-b9f5-5a3479645781.27f8b9a0-9e9a-4c8f-962e-228c777f4079","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#336699","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.21725.13510798887339475.f42ef40b-df42-48e3-a165-acbf058de5b7.01d4075b-bb47-4369-8c48-93a35a360324","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25048.13510798887339475.1640922e-a6f6-44b4-a82f-dc6497b556a6.a3b4d7b4-d957-4586-ad7a-beaeb38e9997","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£4.19⁺","Price":4.19,"AverageRating":3.7,"RatingsCount":"9","PackageFamilyNames":["TelltaleGames.TheWalkingDeadMichonne_4p9dzwrngadje"],"ContentIds":["d36a3091-4548-ef7d-27f3-b551892a1aa5"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"The Walking Dead: Michonne - A Telltale Miniseries stars the iconic, blade-wielding character from Robert Kirkman's best-selling comic books.

Players within a partnership face each other across a table. Traditionally, the players are referred to by the points of the compass - North, East, South and West.

Rick must secure the safety of the group by seeking out a safe escape route from each area, and manage several dangerous tasks to keep as many of the group alive as possible. The game faithfully matches the timeline of the comics, meaning Rick must first fight his way out of the Harrison Memorial Hospital, visit the Greene family farm before visiting destinations such as the Meirwether Correctional Facility and Woodbury.\r\n\r\nProtect the living and escape the dead as you play through the award-winning comic's epic story.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH680N9","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Fire: Ungh's Quest","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18068.13510798886656070.f4bfe227-c95e-415c-9fcd-c2c20a63eb9b.9a050282-3b5f-407e-9156-4966fb1e15eb","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46631.13510798886656070.13cd6acf-85f5-4663-bf41-45b4fbc5c0e7.53654259-d0a6-458f-a582-a3b7f7d7d48b","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23883.13510798886656070.1ad2fc27-c995-4434-9240-7297d6319545.21e9ed95-ed3b-4fff-b55a-b6e5c4b8f60d","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10213.13510798886656070.2a82dc16-095e-4b33-8a04-c4cfd0b0d4be.95df7de5-2157-4e2d-96bf-d071f75c93c7","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48470.13510798886656070.04b2b62d-768b-4a68-ac57-5e5a4633bbc6.ee4ae6a7-bbe1-4d7e-9174-a7dac6c89645","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63599.13510798886656070.fbbed91b-6e46-4301-8b37-b009dbc690ee.afe25061-869b-40f9-ba7f-cbade8f3be8f","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.16362.13510798886656070.5ea0de71-fdde-4735-b336-9c296a8bdc73.dfef637d-7568-46a2-bd7c-26b1376e59f5","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40489.13510798886656070.cf4a4b0d-6c57-4779-92b4-84ebcff9d7fa.8ee68c4f-a415-47c1-9fa0-f9bf635a8a22","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32389.13510798886656070.3cb8afda-46ec-4826-a69b-d2779e61e125.31f11e9f-1f16-49c5-a739-21a0fdd6fe30","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46172.13510798886656070.c957cff1-a591-475f-9f69-f103b75c34f2.88e8fa6c-9e6a-437e-a89e-9c21026bb1a0","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£2.49","Price":2.49,"AverageRating":4.2,"RatingsCount":"11","PackageFamilyNames":["DaedalicEntertainment.FireUnghsQuest_9w6n57xt7hhbc"],"ContentIds":["a06c8fcb-5fcd-37cf-7a98-806d4d6ef61c"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"FIRE is a puzzleventure with intuitive puzzle design.

A small dash of logic and you'll be able to solve any puzzle and there will be no limit to your exploratory spirit while interacting with the game's world: fire coconuts from a mammoth's trunk, turn into an animal or save the fair maiden from the Octo-Boss' grasp.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH6D77X","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Playcast","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44535.13510798886772557.c3745ed0-b823-4949-9bf7-ea6a9dfd0fd2.686c7f78-c66f-464d-b409-f5a55e609181","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#272727","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51627.13510798886772557.3b33375b-3816-4c6c-acd5-f8cd1776ab96.d45b453c-8430-4446-8527-50fe295c9dc7","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#272727","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.43874.13510798886772557.75ba321a-0902-4786-8bf4-58fd41e3b8b5.173fccba-9f89-4d08-b57f-c800fb8625eb","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#272727","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44856.13510798886772557.8ea2db53-6d1c-417b-999a-6ec4573f4823.93f101e1-5fe7-439a-96a3-224b8df207d2","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#272727","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3508.13510798886772557.bd2d4bb2-f98f-498c-aebe-def25dd958ac.28178153-3407-4dad-a601-1784fdf4adcc","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#272727","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22797.13510798886772557.26e1a8e5-767d-4dae-bbfe-2a5041e2a0fb.60031d0b-7a45-40f4-8044-c64018ac4444","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#272727","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3637.13510798886772557.d9d45e52-5a85-4175-a463-c838bbd00f78.e6400a90-564f-4349-aaa1-f6a4b30de338","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#272727","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37910.13510798886772557.6c1a127b-b866-4b3a-9ede-09d44c588418.fa377211-683c-4968-af3e-fb5c65f427c2","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#272727","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26061.13510798886772557.db7e1749-50c6-4bec-ba56-ca3e5a7445f9.534d7c8a-de0f-4fc7-90d4-291e5ddc1e1b","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#272727","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9822.13510798886772557.bd763e83-89c9-4afb-afd6-af8cde7ec420.abe91baa-a195-4059-82d1-9cbf32a95b68","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#272727","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£4.19","Price":4.19,"AverageRating":3.3,"RatingsCount":"55","PackageFamilyNames":["Webrox.Playcast_0dmhevbabqz82"],"ContentIds":["0114f9cc-6ef6-ccb5-f6ae-01fca9a77b95","496cfb64-1bb7-7fe0-a4c7-aba4032780a0"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"   ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Xbox One,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Playcast is an awesome Media Player for playing or casting your videos, songs or pictures to your TV, Chromecast, Chromecast Audio -

Grid is a program which makes it easy to add a gridded overlay onto an image. In other words, it squares up the image for you.\r\n\r\nSplitting an image up into sections, to help us draw it, is something humans have been doing for centuries. With the dawn of the twenty-first century, though, it seems we have let this technique stagnate. We are still drawing the grid by hand and that includes computers (line or pen tool anyone?). I am sure you agree when I say it is a good thing to teach children how to do by hand in their art class. But... it becomes tedious the more you do it and, once you know how to do it, there is very little to learn or improve upon. This is where Paint Grid comes in.\r\n\r\nTo use Paint Grid, drag and drop a .jpg or .png file into the preview area. Use the control panel on the right to adjust the amount of rows and columns you want. After that, set the thickness of the grid lines and its colour and when you are ready, click \"Save As\". From there, you can either print it or open it in your go-to painting/drawing application.\r\n\r\nBy using Paint Grid, you are reducing a task which can take tens of minutes (sometimes over an hour) to mere seconds. All you changes happen in real-time, as well, so you are no longer bound to a certain size once you start. If you do not like the look of your grid, make a change and watch it update straight away. If you are bad at maths, play about with the settings until you find something you like. Most of all, let Paint Grid do the tedious stuff so you can get to the good part faster.","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PGM5BZP30RC","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Kevin Toms Football Star Manager","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47155.14182833654005938.e0cdadb4-4b9d-4ff1-a512-d3aadbb9510c.a0f5204c-78e4-4222-818a-3d0b42eea8db","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£3.99","Price":3.99,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"4","PackageFamilyNames":["KevinTomsLtd.KevinTomsFootballStarManager_fpmphnz65486w"],"ContentIds":["d49cd1b7-ce0d-c2b2-5b01-1bece91817ca"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Kevin Toms wrote the original Football Manager, considered an all time classic and still played by many, decades later.\r\n(Note: requires minimum Open GL 2.1- this was released in 2006, and is built in to your computer video card)\r\nWith Football Star Manager, he has re-created the addictive fun of that game, for modern devices. \r\n\r\nPick your team, buy and sell players, work your strategy and go for it, with the Match Highlights showing what happens in an exciting way.\r\n\r\nIt is a game you can take with you and play anytime and build up your saved game history of your team.

The popular speed reading app is finally available on Windows 8 and 10!\r\n- Significant increases in your reading speed \r\n- Eye-exercises and improvements in your mental capacity \r\n\r\nThis speed reading app provides everything you need to read texts of all types faster, more effectively and most of all, with better retention. \r\n\r\nThe PowerReader allows you to get your daily work done while practicing important reading skills. \r\nLearning reading techniques has never been this much fun! \r\nDouble your reading speed in just a few days. \r\n\r\nTrial users have used this software to increase their reading speed by an average of 143% in 10 days. \r\n\r\nDo you currently need 30 minutes to read the daily paper? Soon you will read two papers and, in addition, another chapter in an interesting non-fiction book – within the same time period. \r\nThis innovative app provides the ideal platform to achieve measurable results with a minimum of effort. \r\n\r\nBut that’s not all: You will have fun mastering the skills you need to attain effective reading techniques and significantly increase your reading speed; this means: \r\n- Rapid recognition of numbers, letters and words \r\n- Flexible eye movements \r\n- Improved ability to concentrate \r\n- Increased vision span \r\n\r\nThe app guides you through the individual training steps. \r\nThe software immediately recognizes your strengths and weaknesses. The statistics function lets you see and track your progress. \r\nThe results of each training exercise are charted for your review. More stars mean that you are getting closer to your objective: more effective reading skills and with it extremely high reading speeds. \r\n\r\nYou can check your reading speed at any time using different reading tests from a variety of topics. \r\nQuestions about the text are used as a secondary test to assess your retention ability. This is the ideal combination for mastering effective reading skills and high retention rates. \r\n\r\nBut beware: you might get hooked since early progress will motivate you to work on your skills regularly. \r\nIt is fun and you are doing something to stay mentally fit at the same time. \r\n\r\nWe recommend that you train regularly but not excessively to ensure best results. \r\n\r\nWho needs this app? \r\n- Anyone reading more than half an hour a day \r\n- Executives \r\n- Secretaries \r\n- High-School and College students \r\n- Purchasing and Sales Professionals \r\n\r\nWho can benefit from this app?

StaffPad handles everything else for you whilst you work. The interface has been designed to reduce clutter, and is context sensitive - showing only the information you want, when you want it.\r\n\r\nPEN AND TOUCH\r\nBy combining the power of digital inking and multitouch, we can offer a no-compromises approach to virtual manuscript. Use your finger to move around the score, and pinch to zoom - with butter-smooth scrolling. When you want to write music, just use the pen. Use your eraser button on the pen to remove both ink strokes and existing notation. You can also draw freehand on the score, using the sketch layer, to quickly brainstorm and leave notes/comments for yourself and others.\r\n\r\nPRINT YOUR RESULTS\r\nStaffPad will intelligently layout the score when it’s time to print. You can print the entire score, as well as individual parts for each musician. StaffPad has smart collision avoidance and music layout rules which handle the reflowing of the music to a page-based layout automatically.\r\n\r\nSHARE YOUR WORK\r\nStaffPad allows you to easily share and export your work. You can export MIDI and MusicXML, should you wish to continue working on your score in other programs. You can also export your score to MP3/WAV format, or quickly email an MP3 of your work in just a couple of taps. StaffPad also supports import of MusicXML and MIDI files.\r\n\r\nSCORE SYNC AND AUTO-SAVE\r\nStaffPad is always saving your score, and keeping track of versions - which you can return to at anytime. By saving your scores to OneDrive, you can ensure that your scores are kept in sync across all your devices. StaffPad also syncs your settings and preferences. You can also organise your scores into ‘collections’, meaning that your scores and projects stay neatly organised, for easy access. You can even pin frequently accessed scores straight to the Start Screen.\r\n\r\nCOMPOSER ASSISTANT\r\nA voice activated composer assistant allows you to interact with your score using your voice. Want to change the key signature to G major at bar 10? No problem - tap the assistant and say \"Change to G major at bar 10\". The assistant can quickly help you set up your score, adding instruments, setting the tempo, the key signature, the time signature, adding barlines, playing from rehearsal marks or specific bars, printing, exporting and transposing your score. Currently, the voice assistant is available in US and UK English only.\r\n\r\nEXPRESS YOURSELF\r\nStaffPad is the first notation application which allows you to easily draw dynamics/music expression data right onto the staff. By toggling the expression layer, you can elegantly draw in additional dynamics detail, which can enhance the realism of playback without compromising the existing dynamics markings on your score.\r\n\r\nPROFESSIONAL FEATURES\r\nStaffPad intelligently handles transposing instruments, allowing you to write in concert pitch and toggle to transposing when you’re ready, or when printing. You can write music in multiple voices, transpose selections, reverse stem directions, quickly repeat bars and insert text intuitively via the  quick input tiles. Quick symbols provide the easiest way to enter trills, tremolos, fermatas, rehearsal marks, pedal markings, hairpins and much more.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION\r\nStaffPad is designed for professional composers and musicians, but it’s also a great learning tool for students. Within the application there are multiple video tutorials explaining how to use the app, and key musical concepts. \r\n\r\nCOMPATIBILITY:\r\nStaffPad REQUIRES a device with a digital pen (also known as an active digitiser) and multitouch capabilities in order to function as designed*. If your device does not support pen and touch, the app will not function correctly. Support will not be available to users attempting to run StaffPad on an incompatible device.\r\n\r\n*StaffPad has been designed for Surface 3, Surface Pro 3 and Surface Pro 4.","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDDWXF","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Reference Generator Pro","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1080.9007199266405350.f8b044de-3411-4419-9328-edc19274c6ce.38f488dc-986f-4aaf-9b26-27f0916acba9","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#151515","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£3.79","Price":3.79,"AverageRating":2.4,"RatingsCount":"5","PackageFamilyNames":["58942ScreechStudios.ReferenceGeneratorPro_zyer19rdd208m"],"ContentIds":["0c47db11-ff0b-d06e-5f8b-881c93352581"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Need help constructing, organizing and managing your academic citations or references?

is the fastest and most user-friendly QR reader and barcode scanner available. If your computer came with a built-in scanner, this would be it. Here is what our reviewers are saying:\r\n\r\n“Quick and very reliable. I’d give it six stars if it were possible.”\r\n“No ads, beautiful design, and even caught blurry QR codes I didn’t expect it to scan”\r\n\r\nHOW THE APP WORKS\r\n\r\nTo scan a QR code or barcode simply open the app, point the camera at the code, and you’re done! There is no need to take a photo or press a button. Scan will automatically recognize any code your camera is pointing at.\r\n\r\nWhen scanning a QR code, if the code contains a website URL, you will automatically be taken to the site. If the code just contains text, you'll immediately see it. For other formats such as phone numbers, email addresses, or contact info, you will be prompted to take the appropriate action.\r\n\r\nPRODUCT BARCODES\r\n\r\nScan recognizes all of the popular barcode types (UPC, EAN, and ISBN) and shows you pricing, reviews, and more about any products you scan. Barcode scanning requires a high-resolution camera in order to work reliably. Cameras on older devices do not provide the resolution or focus required for barcode scanning.\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL FEATURES\r\n\r\n• Scan using any webcam connected to your PC\r\n• View a history list of all of your past scans\r\n\r\nDEDICATED TO PERFECTION\r\n\r\nOur goal is to make our app the best scanning app in the store. We can’t do this without you. We are dedicated to your satisfaction and need to hear feedback from you. If you have an issue with Scan, please do not write a review of the app saying \"it didn't work.\" This does not help us make things better for you. Instead, please contact us at support@scan.me or on Twitter @scan and we'll do our best to help.\r\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS\r\n\r\nIn order to use Scan, your device must have a webcam connected.

For optimal and accurate results, leave it running uninterrupted by not using any other programs until all scores are calculated and appear on screen.\r\n\r\nThe app shows a \"working\" background animation while all necessary System Assessment tests are being run. This can take several minutes.\r\n\r\nWhen finished, the Windows Experience Index will be shown. \r\n\r\nAlso, you now can save a screenshot of your scores (in PNG format).\r\n\r\n★ Purpose ★\r\n\r\nThis app is a solution for the absence of the original graphical user interface (GUI) of WinSAT to Windows 10.

display Windsurfing, Team, Match, Radio or Kiteboard Racing amendments for your convenience.\r\n\r\nThere are also useful features such as pop-ups for all definitions where they are referenced in the
